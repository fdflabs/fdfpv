/*
 * rates.js: the pilot's rate profile, and the only place it is decided.
 *
 * WHY RATES ARE NOT IN A TUNE FILE.
 *
 * They were, and it made the tunes impossible to compare. The Karate race
 * preset shipped with sugarK's own racing rates, 420 deg/s and 54 expo
 * against the Betaflight default's 670 and none, so switching to it changed
 * the tune AND halved the stick authority in one keypress. The owner flew it
 * and reported the obvious: the default felt better and Karate did not, which
 * is what happens when you change two things and only mean to change one.
 *
 * That preset is no longer shipped at all, and the rule outlived it. It is
 * still why no file in configs/ may carry a rateprofile, and scripts/fc-trace.js
 * F7 and F8 now read every file in that directory rather than the one that
 * misbehaved, so the claim cannot be deleted by deleting a file.
 *
 * A tune is P, I, D, feedforward and filtering. Rates are how far the sticks
 * go. They are separate settings on a real radio, they belong to the pilot
 * rather than to the tune, and they are separate here: no file in configs/
 * carries a rateprofile, and this module owns the rate profile for every
 * tune including a diff the pilot drops on the page.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THE LISTS WENT.
 *
 * This used to offer five knobs, each a step on a short list: Max rate from
 * a list that stopped at 1400, Centre sensitivity from a list that stopped at
 * 140, ACTUAL rates only, roll and pitch welded together. A pilot who flies
 * 1500 deg/s, or 850, or anything not on the list, could not type it, and a
 * pilot who thinks in Betaflight RC Rate and Super Rate could not enter their
 * own numbers at all. That was reported as the bug it is.
 *
 * So the shape is Betaflight Configurator's shape: a rates TYPE, and three
 * numbers per axis in the units that type displays. The ranges below are
 * Configurator 10.10's own (`changeRatesSystem` in tabs/pid_tuning.js), which
 * are narrower than the firmware's uint8 in the deg/s columns because the
 * setpoint is clamped at rate_limit, 1998 deg/s, and a column that offered
 * 2550 would be offering nothing.
 *
 * UNITS. Everything stored here is the CLI uint8 the firmware holds, not the
 * number the menu shows. Display and storage differ by a per type SCALE:
 * ACTUAL shows rc_rate 7 as 70 deg/s, BETAFLIGHT shows rc_rate 100 as 1.00,
 * and the same uint8 means both. One firmware unit is one step of the menu,
 * which is why a step is not stored: there is nothing between two uint8s.
 *
 * THE CURVES ARE NOT HERE. src/fc/ratescurve.js transcribes all five of
 * Betaflight's rate functions for drawing, and the compiled module flies its
 * own. scripts/fc-trace.js F15 sweeps the two against each other for every
 * type, which is what makes a preview worth drawing.

 * The throttle cap, as a percentage of full throttle.

 * WHY A RACE QUAD NEEDS ONE. This airframe is 9.7 : 1 static thrust to
 * weight, which is what a 710 g 5 inch on 6S with T-Motor's 1950 kV
 * motors really is, and it hovers at 24.4 percent of stick
 * (scripts/flightcheck.js measures both; 8.4 and 26.2 before the five
 * inch moved to T-Motor's published row on 2026-10-01). So three quarters of the throttle travel is above hover, the useful
 * band around it is a couple of percent of stick, and ten percent of stick
 * takes you from holding altitude to climbing at 9 m/s. That is not a bug in
 * the model, it is what the aircraft is, and it is exactly why the throttle
 * limit exists in Betaflight and why racers use it.
 *
 * SCALE, NOT CLIP, and the difference is the whole point. Betaflight offers
 * both in flight/mixer.c applyThrottleLimit:
 *
 *   CLIP    output = min(stick, cap).   Stick above the cap does nothing.
 *           The travel is thrown away and the resolution below is unchanged.
 *   SCALE   output = stick * cap.       Full stick travel is redistributed
 *           across nothing-to-cap, so every millimetre of stick is worth
 *           `cap` as much throttle and the resolution improves by 1/cap.
 *
 * SCALE is the one that gives resolution back. At 60 percent, hover moves
 * from 26.2 to 40 percent of stick and the stick is two thirds as touchy; at
 * 40 percent, hover sits past half stick, which is the classic setup.
 *
 * The cap is NOT reimplemented here. These two lines go into the rate profile
 * and Betaflight's own mixer does the work, per CLAUDE.md: if a Betaflight
 * behaviour is missing, compile more of Betaflight rather than approximate
 * it. It was already compiled; nothing had ever switched it on.

 * Where hover lands on the stick at each cap, as a percentage of travel.

 * MEASURED, NOT DERIVED, and the difference is the reason this is a table
 * rather than a formula. The obvious formula is hover divided by the cap,
 * because SCALE multiplies the mixer's throttle by it. That overstates every
 * value, by six percentage points at a cap of 40, because thrust is not
 * linear in the throttle command: the pack sags and the motors load up, so
 * halving the command does not halve the thrust and the stick does not have
 * to come up as far as the algebra says.
 *
 * These are read off the compiled module by scripts/flightcheck.js, which
 * bisects for the throttle that holds altitude at each cap. Re-run it if the
 * plant changes. It is in the menu because "60 percent" means nothing to a
 * pilot and "hover near a third of the stick" means everything.
 */
/*
 * ONE COLUMN PER AIRCRAFT, because hover does not land in the same place on
 * the stick on both. A 23 g whoop hovers at 32.3 percent of travel uncapped
 * where a 710 g five inch hovers at 26.5, and the gap widens under a cap:
 * the sag and the motor loading that make this a measurement rather than an
 * algebraic hover-over-cap are different on a 1S 280 mAh pack and a 6S one.
 *
 * Re-recorded in full on 2026-09-06 with `node scripts/flightcheck.js` and
 * `node scripts/flightcheck.js --airframe=whoop65`. The five inch column
 * moved by 0.2 to 0.6 of a point from the figures stored before that, which
 * is the plant drifting under it since the table was first taken; nothing
 * reads these but the menu, and a table half of one vintage and half of
 * another is worse than one taken in a single run.
 *
 * The 75 row was taken in the same way when 75 joined the list. Both columns
 * were re-read on the build that added the descent rotor drag, and neither
 * moved: that term is exactly zero at and above a hover, and a hover is the
 * only thing this table measures.
 */
/*
 * READ AT THE WEIGHT THE SHELL FLIES, NOT THE HARNESS'S. The module's own
 * gravity is 1.0 and every check in tests/ runs there; the shell asserts
 * configs/airframes.js gravityBase, 1.62, through sim_set_gravity before a
 * pilot ever touches the stick, and a menu that quoted the 1.0 hover to a
 * pilot flying at 1.62 would be eight and a half points low at every cap.
 * So:
 *
 *     node scripts/flightcheck.js --gravity=1.62
 *
 * which is the same bisection with the same flag the shell uses. The 1.0
 * table it replaced read 26.5, 28.9, 31.8, 33.6, 35.6, 38.0, 40.8, 47.9,
 * 58.6, for anyone reading an old report against a new one.
 *
 * ONE TABLE FOR BOTH ENTRIES, because configs/airframes.js gives both a
 * simId of 0: the shell's whoop flies the five inch plant, so its hover is
 * the five inch's. The whoop column this replaced, 33.6 at cap 100, had been
 * read off SIM_AIRFRAME_WHOOP65 with --airframe=whoop65, which selects a
 * plant the shell does not, and had been quoting a machine nobody flew since
 * that entry moved to simId 0. If a whoop plant is ever selected again it
 * gets its own row read at its own gravityBase.
