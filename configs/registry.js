/*
 * registry.js: the tunes the shell offers, and the only place any of them
 * is named.
 *
 * A tune is a Betaflight CLI diff in this directory and nothing else. The
 * module parses it with the same code path a dropped file takes, so an
 * entry here has no privileges a pilot's own dump does not have. Adding a
 * tune is a file plus a row.
 *
 * NO TUNE HERE SETS RATES. Rates are the pilot's, chosen in Settings and
 * appended to whichever tune is loaded; see rates.js. A tune that carried a
 * rateprofile would be overridden by that append rather than winning
 * silently, but the right fix is not to carry one.
 *
 * `id` is the file's basename. It is also the localStorage key's value, so
 * changing one orphans a stored choice; src/ui/ui.js falls back to the
 * first row rather than throwing, because a stale setting must never stop
 * the page booting.
 *
 * ONE SHIPPED TUNE, AND IT IS STOCK. Karate race 6S and Precision used to
 * sit below the default and they are gone, files and rows both. A shipped
 * tune is an opinion about how a quad should feel, and this simulator's
 * whole claim is that it feels like the real thing, so the honest starting
 * point is the one a freshly flashed board actually gives you and every
 * other feel is the pilot's own. The Flight controller screen and the PIDs
 * screen are where they make it: both write real Betaflight keys, a Save
 * becomes CUSTOM_TUNE below, and that dump sits on the Tune row beside this
 * one. So the set did not shrink from three answers to one, it shrank from
 * three answers to one plus yours.

 * THE THREE WHOOP PRESETS ARE RETIRED, and `airframe: null` above is how.

 * They were the whoop's, and they were right for as long as the whoop was a

 * whoop preset on it is not a different feel, it is the wrong tune: P and D
 * sized against 6e-6 kg m^2 of inertia, filter cutoffs against a 23 g frame's
 * resonances, and gains that come off a fifth of the way up the stick because
 * a cell sags. That is an underdamped, sluggish machine, which is the exact
 * complaint the plant change exists to answer.
 *
 * They stay in the table and their .diff files stay on disk. They are real
 * published configurations, scripts/preset-lint.js still checks every .diff in
 * this directory against the compiled module, and if the whoop ever gets its
 * own plant back they are two characters from being offered again. What they
 * must not be is reachable for a plant they were never written for.
 *
 * That is NOT what happened to Karate race 6S and Precision. Those two were
 * right for the plant they were offered on and were removed anyway, as a
 * decision about what this simulator should ship rather than about what flies
 * on what, so their rows and their files both went. A retirement keeps the
 * file because the tune may be wanted again; a removal does not.
