/*
 * pids.js: the pilot's PID adjustment, and the only place it is decided.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The flight-controller screen went because eight tabs and a
 * CLI textarea helped nobody, and for a while the PIDs went with it: two
 * fixed tunes and no way to move them. A beta tester then reported both
 * tunes floppy and said they used to push the PIDs to 200-300 percent.
 * This module is the answer: Betaflight Configurator's own tuning sliders,
 * and an expert table for setting PIDs directly, with no CLI paste
 * anywhere. That report was once answered with a preset as well, a stiff
 * cut shipped beside the default. The presets are gone and the control is
 * the whole answer now, which is the right way round: a pilot who wants a
 * stiffer quad should move the knob and know what they moved.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE COMPUTES A PID. A slider adjustment is emitted as the
 * firmware's own `set simplified_*` keys followed by the real CLI command
 * `simplified_tuning apply`, so the arithmetic that turns a master
 * multiplier of 185 into P83 is Betaflight's config/simplified_tuning.c,
 * compiled into the module, exactly as it is when Configurator drags a
 * slider. The expert table is emitted as plain `set p_roll = ...` lines
 * with `simplified_pids_mode = OFF`, which is exactly what Configurator's
 * expert mode writes. Per CLAUDE.md: the behaviour was already compiled,
 * this file only asks for it.
 *
 * PER TUNE, NOT PER PILOT, and this is the decision that makes the tunes
 * stay comparable. Rates are global because how far the stick goes belongs
 * to the hand that holds it; PIDs belong to the tune, so an adjustment is
 * keyed by tune id and switching tunes switches to that tune's own
 * adjustment (usually none). A single global override would make the Tune
 * row a lie: every choice would fly the same numbers.
 *
 * SPARSE ON PURPOSE. A slider the pilot has not moved is not stored and
 * not emitted, so the tune's own value keeps governing it; move the master
 * on a tune and that tune's own I, D and feedforward sliders keep doing
 * their work underneath it, which is what Configurator does with a preset
 * loaded. Putting a slider back on the tune's own value deletes the
 * override rather than storing a copy, so "back where it was" and "stock"
 * are the same state and the same config text, and the best-lap record key
 * (a hash of that text) agrees.
 *
 * UNITS AND BOUNDS. Sliders are the firmware's uint8 percent, 100 is the
 * tune's own scale. The compiled CLI shim does not enforce the valueTable
 * ranges (it took 250 and flew it, measured), so the menu owns the clamp:
 * 200 is SIMPLIFIED_TUNING_MAX and the six sliders that scale a gain are
 * floored at 30 here, because a master of zero is a craft with no
 * controller, reported as a physics bug by whoever types it. Zero of
 * feedforward and zero of dynamic damping are real setups and stay legal.
 * The expert table uses the firmware's own bounds from the 4.5.1
 * valueTable: PID_GAIN_MAX 250, D_MIN_GAIN_MAX 250, F_GAIN_MAX 1000.
