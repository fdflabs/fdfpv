/*
 * selftest.js: what the edge router does to a URL, checked without an edge.
 *
 * The router is fifty lines of string handling standing between every visitor
 * and every one of the three deploys, and the way it fails is not a crash: it
 * is a request that lands on the wrong upstream and answers 404, or a missing
 * trailing slash that sends the simulator's own module graph into the landing
 * page's namespace. Neither shows up in a syntax check and both look like the
 * app is broken rather than the mount.
 *
 * So: stub fetch, drive the handler, and assert on the URL it asked for. No
 * network, no wrangler, no account. Run it with `npm run test:edge`.
