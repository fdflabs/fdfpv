/*
 * router.js: the Cloudflare Worker that makes three deploys look like one site.
 *
 * THE MAP, WRITTEN DOWN ONCE.
 *
 *   https://fdfpv.example/          the landing page, from GitHub Pages
 *   https://fdfpv.example/sim/      the simulator, from its Render static site
 *   https://fdfpv.example/board/    the board, from its Render web service
 *
 * Every request to fdfpv.example lands here. This file picks an upstream by the
 * first path segment, takes that segment off, and passes the rest through
 * untouched. The upstreams still serve from their own roots and do not know
 * they are mounted anywhere: /sim/dist/sim.wasm arrives at Render as
 * /dist/sim.wasm, and /board/api/tracks arrives at the board as /api/tracks.
 *
 * WHY A WORKER AND NOT A REDIRECT RULE. A redirect would put onrender.com in
 * the address bar, which is the thing the domain exists to stop. A Cloudflare
 * Origin Rule cannot do it either: stripping a prefix needs regex_replace in a
 * rewrite rule, which is not on the free plan, and both upstreams route by
 * Host, so an origin override alone would land on the wrong site.
 *
 * WHY THE TRAILING SLASH REDIRECT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. The three apps
 * now resolve their own files relative to the page rather than from the site
 * root, so that they work at / on Render and at /sim/ here without knowing
 * which. A browser sitting at /sim resolves "src/boot.js" against the site
 * root and asks for /src/boot.js, which is the landing page's namespace, not
 * the simulator's. Sitting at /sim/ it asks for /sim/src/boot.js, which is
 * right. So /sim and /board are permanent redirects to /sim/ and /board/, and
 * that redirect is load bearing rather than tidiness.
