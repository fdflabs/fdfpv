 * FLOW: every hole has to send the pilot towards the next one.
 *
 * Reported from the cockpit: "the tunnel on the track, the first gate is
 * asking the pilot to go the wrong way". On 2025 WA States the five gate
 * tunnel is flown east to west, and gates 17 to 20 all carried entry -1,
 * westward, while gate 16 at the mouth carried +1. The tunnel told you to
 * turn round and fly back out of it.
 *
 * WHY THE AUTO FACE RULE PICKED IT. For an element whose heading is fixed,
 * faces.js chooses the entry sign from the dot of the aperture normal with
 * the BISECTOR of the turn, the chord from the previous knot to the next. At
 * the mouth of a tunnel you arrive from the side and leave straight down it,
 * so the bisector is nearly square to the hole: at gate 16 that dot is 0.17,
 * which is noise, and the sign it produced was a coin toss that landed wrong.
 * The bisector is the right question at a corner and the wrong one here.
 *
 * WHY fixReversals DID NOT CATCH IT. Flipping gate 16 trades a departure
 * reversal for an arrival one, so the loop oscillates and gives up. But the
 * two are not equal. The DEPARTURE is a rule the pilot has to obey, because
 * it is which way through the hole they must go; the arrival is a manoeuvre,
 * and swinging round to the mouth of a tunnel is a normal thing to fly. So
 * flow is judged on the departure alone, and it wins.
 *

 * same place, so the chord between them is a wrap rather than a leg and
 * carries no direction to agree with.

 *
 * For an element whose heading is DERIVED rather than authored, faces.js

 * half turn when entry is -1. So the tangent, which is entry times the
 * normal, always comes back to the bisector, and flipping the sign rotates
 * the gate instead of turning the line round. On a leg that goes out to a
 * gate and back the way it came, the bisector points the OPPOSITE way to the
 * departure, so the flip achieved nothing and the loop span. 2023 GQ Scale's
 * gate 14 is exactly that: in from the west, out to the west again.
 *
 * So a derived heading is re-aimed down the departure and pinned, which is
 * the only heading that can satisfy the flow rule. An AUTHORED heading is
 * never turned, because the .trk is the authority on it; there only the sign
 * moves. Neither is done to a structure flown more than once, because one
