/*
 * verify.js: the npm run verify entry point. Runs every Stage 1 check from
 * STAGE1.md, prints one table row per check with the measured value, the
 * threshold and PASS, FAIL or SKIP, then exits non-zero if anything failed.
 * A check can fail and it can never crash the runner.
 *
 * SKIP is narrow and it is loud. It means the check's TOOLCHAIN is not on
 * this machine, which is not the same thing as the check failing, and only
 * check 1 can reach it: emcc absent and vendor/betaflight not checked out
 * means there is nothing to build and nothing to compare, so "FAIL, build
 * exited 1" was reporting a broken build on a machine that never had the
 * compiler. It named the wrong thing and it named it every run. A skipped
 * check still prints its row, still prints WHY, and is counted separately in
 * the summary line so a green run cannot quietly mean an unbuilt one. When
 * emcc IS present the skip is unreachable and check 1 behaves as it always
 * did, so this cannot hide a real build break from anybody who can build.
