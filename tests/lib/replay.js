/*
 * replay.js: drive a Sim through a recorded input stream or a scripted
 * stick program, collect a state trace, and hash it.
 *
 * Environment-neutral module, runs unchanged in Node and the browser.
 * Hashing uses WebCrypto SHA-256 over the raw little-endian state block
 * bytes, so no number formatting is involved anywhere near the hash.
 *
 * Input delivery rule, identical everywhere: an input sample with
 * timestamp tUs is delivered to sim_input before the 1 ms step covering
 * [floor(tUs / 1000), floor(tUs / 1000) + 1) ms executes. The render rate
 * only changes how many whole steps are batched into one sim_step call.
 * By construction the harness delivers the same samples before the same
 * steps at every render rate; a sim that honours the ABI therefore
 * produces bit-identical traces.
