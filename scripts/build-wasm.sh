# Betaflight IS compiled in: its controller objects are listed below and
# linked alongside src/native. The two patches in patches/ are applied to
# the vendor tree before those objects are built and reverted by the EXIT
# trap afterwards, so vendor/betaflight is never modified in place and
# `git diff --stat vendor/betaflight` must remain empty after a build.

# Determinism flags are load-bearing: no fast math, no fp contraction, no

# lives in a function so the trap does not re-parse '\r' as the letter r.
