/*
 * score-selftest.js: the freestyle scoring system, proven in Node.
 *
 * Three things are checked here and they are three different kinds of
 * claim, which is why they are one file rather than three.
 *
 *   1. THE TRANSCRIPTION. src/game/tricks.js says it carries the owner's
 *      workbook. This reads the extracted workbook back out of
 *      tests/fixtures/freestyle-scoring/twp-calculator.json and compares
 *      it name for name and point for point. A catalogue that has drifted
 *      from its source is worse than no catalogue, because it still looks
 *      authoritative.
 *
 *   2. THE RECOGNISER. Synthetic body-rate traces are pushed through
 *      src/game/trickdetect.js one millisecond at a time, exactly as the
 *      shell pushes real ones, and the tricks that come out are compared
 *      against what was flown. This is the part that could silently be
 *      wrong forever: a detector that names a Rubik's Cube as three
 *      separate rolls still produces a score, just the wrong one.
 *
 *   3. THE ARITHMETIC. Sequences are scored through src/game/score.js and
 *      compared against totals worked out by hand from the workbook's own
 *      formulas, written out in the comments so the reader can check them
 *      without the spreadsheet open.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/score-selftest.js   (npm run score:selftest)
 * Exit code is the failure count, like the other selftests.

 * world, which is that a rotation about a horizontal body axis inverts the
 * craft exactly when it covers a half-integer number of turns.

 * a trick has more than one part, and it hid a real defect in the snap:
