/*
 * craft-check.js: the drawn aircraft against the hull that sweeps it, and
 * both against the real machine, for every airframe the shell offers.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM CHECK 15.
 *
 * tests/verify.js check 15 has asserted since it was written that "the
 * collisions hug the graphics", and it does it well, for the five inch: it
 * finds the body's box and the prop discs' cylinders by their five inch
 * sizes, and it is pinned to a baseline measured at one window size with one
 * course seeded. None of that reaches the whoop, which is drawn by a
 * different builder out of ducts and a bumper hoop and has no cylinder over
 * 50 mm on it. So the second aircraft in the project has never had the one
 * check that would catch a scale error on it.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES, and it is deliberately dumb: every VERTEX of every mesh
 * the model draws, transformed into the craft's own frame, minus the
 * outline hulls, which are back sided shells scaled 1.13 and are paint. A
 * bounding box would do for a slab and lies about a torus, whose box corner
 * is 1.41 of its radius; the vertices are the silhouette itself. Out of
 * them come three numbers: how far the machine reaches from its centre
 * across, how far it reaches up, and how far it reaches down.
 *
 * Those go against three things:
 *
 *   the COLLIDER, src/game/collide.js, which sweeps CRAFT_R across and
 *     [-CRAFT_V_DOWN, +CRAFT_V_UP] vertically and is what a gate, a pole and
 *     a wall are tested against;
 *   the PLANT, src/native/plant.c, whose contact hull rests the craft on the
 *     ground and whose numbers configs/airframes.js snapshots; and
 *   the REAL AIRCRAFT, whose published size is in the comments of the model
 *     and the airframe table: a 220 mm five inch, and a 65 mm whoop
 *     with a 65 mm wheelbase across 82.6 mm of frame.
 *
 * Run it with `npm run check:craft`. It boots the shell once per aircraft,
 * so it costs about half a minute.

 *   5inch     a 220 mm class quad: 110 mm arms, 5 inch blades, so the disc
 *             the aircraft sweeps is 173.5 mm and the body is 155 mm long.
 *   whoop65   a 65 mm whoop: 65 mm motor to motor across the
 *             diagonal, 82.6 mm square over the ducts, 23.4 g.
 *
 *   wing1000  a 1000 mm flying wing: the span is the number on the box,
 *             and the diagonal reach is the winglet's trailing corner, half
 *             a metre out and 215 mm aft of the CG because of the sweep, so
 *             the wing reaches 44 mm further from its centre than its half
 *             span. src/render/wingcraft.js derives the planform.
 *   sky1800   an 1800 mm twin boom pusher: the span is the manufacturer's,
 *             and the reach is the wingtip, because the tail, 0.77 m aft,
 *             is only 0.23 m out. src/render/skycraft.js draws it.
 *   cub1400   a 1400 mm Piper J-3 Cub: the span is FMS's, and the reach is
 *             the tip, the tail being 0.6 m aft on the centreline.
 *             src/render/cubcraft.js draws it.
 *   radian2000 a 2000 mm E-flite Radian: the span is E-flite's, and the
 *             reach is the tip's trailing corner, 137 mm aft of the CG,
 *             since the fin's is 0.83 m aft on the centreline.
 *             src/render/glidercraft.js draws it.
 *
 * `spanMm` is the AXIS ALIGNED width, two ducts about two motors, which is
 * the figure a manufacturer prints; `sweepMm` is the diagonal reach, which
 * is what a collider sweeps. They are different numbers about one machine
 * and both are checked. `wheelbaseMm` is the motor to motor figure a quad
 * is named for; a wing has none.
