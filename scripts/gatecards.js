/*
 * gatecards.js: the three pictures on the front door, drawn by the game.
 *
 * The first screen asks one question, what to fly, and it asks it with three
 * pictures rather than three words, because the difference between them is a
 * difference between PLACES and a sentence is a poor way to describe a
 * place. See PROGRESS.md for the argument.
 *
 * WHY THEY ARE FILES AND NOT LIVE. The shell already records a short clip of
 * a world for the picker cards, and it records the world the player is
 * actually in, so a world nobody has visited has no clip. The gate is the
 * screen a first visit opens on: whatever it shows has to be there before
 * anything has been flown, on the first frame, with no network. That is a
 * file. Two of them, and they are frames of the REAL renderer through
 * scripts/shots.js, the same harness og.js uses, so they cannot drift into
 * being a drawing of a game that no longer looks like this.
 *
 * REGENERATE, DO NOT EDIT, the same rule as og.js and the icons:
 *
 *     npm run gen:gatecards
 *
 * WHAT EACH FRAME IS, and why those numbers.
 *
 * Race is a lit start gate at eleven metres, left of centre, with the course
 * markers running away to the right and the rest of the gates small behind
 * them. The green is the renderer's own "this is the way through" and it is
 * the one colour in this product that means racing. The track under it is
 * tracks/json/trk-0870b164.json, the 2022 AU Nationals layout, because a
 * real published course is the honest thing to photograph and it is already
 * in the repository.
 *
 * Whoop is the same shot at a fifth of the size: the room's own lit start
 * gate at two and a half metres, left of centre, with the rest of the track
 * running away to the right and the skirting board and the wall behind it,
 * because "indoors" is the whole claim that card makes. The track is
 * tracks/json/micro-livingroom-1.json, which ships with the simulator, and
 * the aircraft has to be the whoop: a micro track is seated per class, so
 * without --airframe the capture would open on the five inch's field.
 *
 * Freestyle is the town from twelve metres up: roofs, wires, sakura and the
 * street running into the haze, with no gate anywhere in it. The camera is
 * high enough to show that it goes on past the frame, which is the whole
 * claim the card is making.
 *
 * The animation clock is parked with __animTo so the train and the level
 * crossing are in the same place on every regeneration. The camera is parked
 * with __setCam for the same reason: the attract camera is always moving, so
 * a capture that just waited would be a different picture every time.
