/*
 * shots.js: drive the real shell in headless Chromium and capture frames.
 *
 * Every rendering bug this project has had was found by looking at a
 * frame, so looking at frames needs to be one command. This serves the
 * repo, opens index.html in Chromium over the DevTools protocol, presses
 * keys, waits, and writes PNGs. The container's Chromium does not inherit
 * the outbound proxy, so requests to the Three.js CDN are paused with the
 * Fetch domain and fulfilled from Node, which does have the proxy, with a
 * local cache so a run does not refetch a megabyte of Three.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/shots.js --out=DIR [--w=1600] [--h=900] [--url=/index.html]
 *                         step step step
 * Steps:
 *   wait:MS          advance wall time
 *   shot:NAME        write DIR/NAME.png, or DIR/NAME.jpg under --jpeg=Q
 *   tap:CODE         key down then up, e.g. tap:Enter
 *   down:CODE        key down, held
 *   up:CODE          key up
 *   eval:EXPR        evaluate in the page and print the value
 *   until:EXPR       poll until EXPR is truthy, fail the run after 20 s
 *   expect:EXPR      fail the run unless EXPR is truthy right now
 *   tstart:ID,X,Y    put touch point ID down at X,Y (needs --touch=1)
 *   tmove:ID,X,Y     drag touch point ID to X,Y
 *   tend:ID          lift touch point ID
 *
 * --touch=1 enables Chromium's touch emulation before the page loads, so
 * navigator.maxTouchPoints reports points and the thumb sticks mount. The
 * harness keeps the set of down points and sends the WHOLE set on every
 * event, which is what the protocol requires for multi-touch.
 *
 * until: and expect: exist because a wait in milliseconds is not evidence
 * of anything. On this container's software rasteriser a frame takes
 * about 120 ms, so a keypress followed by wait:400 can screenshot the
 * screen the player was on BEFORE the key, and the file gets a name that
 * lies. A capture of a named state must assert that state.
 *
 * Console errors and warnings are collected and printed at the end, so the
 * same run that produces the screenshots also answers the console gate.
