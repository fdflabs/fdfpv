/*
 * fc-trace.js: prove LIVE / INERT / GATED against the compiled module.
 *
 * Round-trip, one-key diffs, dyn notch at 1 kHz, and the rates policy
 * (keep-mine must not let a dump steal roll_srate). Hashes are SHA-256
 * of raw state blocks, same as the harness, over a short stick program.
 *
 * Each hash loads a fresh module. Check 2 does the same: two in-process
 * hashes are two instantiations, not two sim_init calls on one instance.
 * A second sim_init on the same WASM is not a power-on. The dump
 * round-trip is "same text, same cold trajectory".

 * the menu writes, the sticks are swept from stop to stop, and every point

 *
 * All three axes, because the menu now writes three, and with a different
 * profile on each so that a check could not pass by reading the wrong one.
 *
 * THE TWO SIGN FLIPS ARE THE POINT OF READING PITCH AND YAW HERE.
 * src/native/bf/bf_glue.c inverts pitch on its way into rcData, and rc.c
 * inverts yaw through GET_DIRECTION(yaw_control_reversed), so the curve a
 * given stick rides on those axes is the mirror of the roll one. Both are
