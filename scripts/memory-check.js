/*
 * memory-check.js: does a map cost nothing until it is chosen, and give the
 * memory back when it is left.
 *
 * WHY, ON A LAPTOP. The freestyle city is 59 vendored source files, about
 * nineteen thousand meshes and a few hundred Canvas2D textures. A pilot who
 * only ever flies a track must not pay for any of it, and a pilot who tries
 * the city and goes back to the field must not keep paying for it either.
 * Both halves are easy to break by accident and neither is visible until a
 * tab runs out of memory on somebody else's machine.
 *
 * WHAT verify's CHECK 16 ALREADY DOES, so this does not repeat it: it proves
 * the city is not fetched while the field is selected, that a full graph
 * arrives once the city is chosen, that MAP_MODULE_COUNT matches what the
 * browser fetched, and that the field's draw cost is unchanged. That check is
 * good and it is the reference for this one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ADDS:
 *
 *   1. The other three maps. Check 16 covers city against field. Industrial
 *      the city is the only freestyle world now, and it copies nothing into
 *      their own directory precisely so choosing one does not drag in the
 *      city's, and nothing was measuring that.
 *   2. Release, not just laziness. After switching away, three.js's own count
 *      of live geometries and textures has to come back down. A lazy load
 *      that never frees is a leak with extra steps.
 *
 * It is a cheap lint rather than part of verify, because verify builds the
 * WASM module and this has nothing to say about the flight model.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/memory-check.js
 *   node scripts/memory-check.js --map=city      just one map
