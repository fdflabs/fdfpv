/*
 * collider-overlay.js: draw the city's solid boxes over the city's picture.
 *
 * scripts/collider-audit.js answers "how much solid has nothing drawn in it"
 * in cubic metres, and a number is the right way to compare two rounds. It is
 * the wrong way to answer the question the owner actually asks, which is a
 * question about a picture: does the barrier stand off the wall it belongs
 * to, is the gap under the verandah open, does the box follow the roof down
 * to the eaves. Those are seen, not counted. So this parks the camera at a
 * few places in the town, draws every collider within a radius as a green
 * wireframe over the rendered frame, and writes the pair of images.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/collider-overlay.js [--out=DIR]
