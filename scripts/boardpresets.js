/*
 * boardpresets.js: put the shipped tracks on a board, cards and all.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The builder ships a set of tracks. A pilot who opens one
 * gets a copy under a fresh id, flies it, and never publishes it, because
 * publishing somebody else's reconstruction under your own name is not a
 * thing most people do. So the board's whoop side stayed almost empty while
 * the simulator carried three finished rooms, and a visitor who arrived at
 * the board first saw a series with one track in it. This is the one way the
 * shipped set reaches the board as itself.
 *
 * THE ID IS DERIVED FROM THE PRESET'S, NOT MINTED. newTrackId is random,
 * which is right for a track a pilot builds and wrong for this: a second run
 * of a random id is a second copy of the same track on the board, which is
 * the exact failure this is meant to repair. sha256 of the preset id, first
 * eight hex, is the same id on every machine and on every run.
 *
 * THE AUTHOR IS WHO BROUGHT THE TRACK OVER, NOT WHO DESIGNED IT. The board's
 * `author` is the seat that published, and the RaceGOW5 set is eight tracks
 * by seven designers reconstructed from the official animations. Crediting
 * the designer in that field would claim they published here, which they did
 * not; the designer, the series and the source ride in the document's own
 * credit block, where the card prints them. So the author is credit.
 * broughtOverBy, and --author overrides it for a fork.
 *
 * WHY IT DRIVES A BROWSER. A room's card on the board is an animation of one
 * lap of it, and only a browser can draw one: the scene is Three.js, Three.js
 * is WebGL, and the board renders nothing and never will. Same machinery as
 * scripts/boardgif.js and for the same reason, which is also why the two
 * produce the same picture: both call exportTrackGif through
 * src/trackbuilder/animate.html.
 *
 * WHY A RE-RUN NEEDS THE TOKEN AND A FIRST RUN DOES NOT. The board mints an
 * edit key on a first publish and that key is the only way to update the
 * track afterwards. This script uses the key it was just handed to upload the
 * card and then forgets it, deliberately: an edit key written to a file in a
 * public repository is a published secret. So a track already on the board is
 * left alone unless --replace is given, and --replace takes it off with
 * BOARD_ADMIN_TOKEN and publishes it again from scratch. That removes the
 * times posted on it, which is why it is a flag and not the default.
 *
 * usage:
 *   node scripts/boardpresets.js --board https://fdfpv.example/board --dry
 *   BOARD_ADMIN_TOKEN=... node scripts/boardpresets.js --board ... --replace
