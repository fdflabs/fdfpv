/*
 * quality-check.js: the graphics presets, against the machines they name.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.
 *
 * quality.js is a table of numbers with a comment above it saying which
 * machine each row is for, and nothing checked that the numbers still meant
 * what the comment said. Three defects lived in there at once and all three
 * were found by reading, not by a check:
 *
 *   - The race field had no pixel budget at all, so a 1440 by 900 laptop
 *     with a 2x panel rendered 5.2 Mpx through three full resolution passes,
 *     about twice the project's own render target ceiling.
 *   - Detection returned High for every machine that was not a Steam Deck,
 *     a phone or an iPad, including the integrated laptop chips the Medium
 *     row explicitly names.
 *   - The Settings notes promised "thinned planting" on a map that has no
 *     planting lever.
 *
 * These are not opinions about how the world should look. They are
 * arithmetic on the table, so they are checkable, and this checks them on
 * every run rather than on the next time somebody reads the file.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not measure a frame, because a frame needs a
 * GPU and this has to run on a laptop with no browser open. Everything here
 * is the table's own numbers and the functions that read them.
