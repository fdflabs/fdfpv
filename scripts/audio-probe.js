/*
 * audio-probe.js: render the real audio graph offline and measure it.
 *
 * There are no speakers in this container, so every claim about the mix has
 * to come from a buffer. This launches headless Chromium, imports
 * src/render/audio.js into a blank same origin page, builds that exact graph
 * on an OfflineAudioContext, drives it from a scripted RPM and airspeed
 * trace through the real update() path, renders it to samples, pulls the
 * samples back into Node, and reports:
 *
 *   peak sample and any sample at or above full scale
 *   RMS in dBFS and true peak in dBTP, oversampled four times
 *   one third octave band energies
 *   the energy in any two named bands, which is what the scream test is
 *   spectral centroid
 *   narrowband tonal peaks in a named range, ranked by how far each stands
 *     above the median of its own neighbourhood. A band table says how much
 *     energy is somewhere; this says whether it is a TONE, which is a
 *     different complaint and the one the owner reported
 *   per channel peak frequencies, for the binaural carriers
 *   amplitude modulation at a named frequency in each channel and in the
 *     mono sum, each against a measured floor. A binaural pair beats in the
 *     mono sum: two carriers a few Hz apart summed ARE an amplitude
 *     modulation, so the discriminator is per channel absence, not mono sum
 *     absence. See .loop/threshold-disputes.md entry 5.
 *   tempo by autocorrelation of spectral flux
 *   the sample delta at a named loop seam against the distribution inside
 *     the loop
 *
 * An FFT cannot tell anyone whether the mix is pleasant. A human has to
 * listen. It can tell anyone whether the mix screams, clips, is at the
 * stated tempo, and is genuinely binaural, and those are the claims this
 * project has been making without evidence.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/audio-probe.js [--trace=NAME] [--seconds=20] [--rate=48000]
 *        [--level=0.6] [--blades=3] [--f0=HZ] [--scream=2000,8000]
 *        [--carrier=80,600] [--beat=6] [--seam=SEC] [--tones=LO,HI]
 *        [--json=PATH] [--voice=quad|wing]
 *
 * Traces: hover, full, flight, steady:RPM, idle, wing.
 *
 * --voice picks the machine's voice, see VOICES in src/render/audio.js, and
 * with it the blade count the fundamental is derived from unless --blades
 * says otherwise. The wing trace is one motor in slot 0 and zeros after, the
 * shape the wing plant reports: a hand throw, a climb to cruise, a throttle
 * chop into a glide, then full throttle.

/*
 * Tempo from the autocorrelation of spectral flux.
 *
 * Three things a reviewer proved wrong about the first version of this, all
 * fixed here, because between them they made the function more confident
 * about music that does not exist than about music that does.
 *
 * It had no null hypothesis. Fed pure white noise it returned 137.20 BPM at
 * r = 0.823, and fed one steady 400 Hz sine it returned 187.50 BPM at
 * r = 0.984, which is a hop artefact and not a tempo. Meanwhile a real
 * synthetic 173 BPM breakbeat reported 173.08 at only r = 0.349, behind its
 * own half tempo. So `nullP95` is now measured, not assumed: the flux
 * sequence is shuffled with a fixed seed and the whole lag search rerun, and
 * the 95th percentile of the shuffled peaks is published beside the real
 * one. An r below that floor means the function found nothing.
 *
 * The lag axis was too coarse to answer the question A5 asks. At hop 256 and
 * 48 kHz the only BPM values reachable inside the 170 to 176 window were
 * 170.455, 173.077 and 175.781, so a genuine 177.0 BPM reported as 175.78
 * and would have PASSED a bar it fails. The hop is now 128 and the peak lag
 * is refined by parabolic interpolation, which makes the reported figure
 * continuous.
 *
 * And the flux was computed over the whole spectrum including the motor's
 * own band, so the motors drove the tempo estimate. It is now band limited
 * to 60 Hz to 10 kHz, which is where a kick, a snare and a hat live.
