/*
 * posters.js: the still on a world card, taken by the world it is a still of.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. A first visit to Freestyle has no clips cached, and
 * making them costs a Three.js scene per world on the main thread. The
 * cards used to spend that minute as four dark rectangles with the word
 * "loading" on them, which is the worst possible moment to tell somebody
 * nothing at all about the places they are choosing between. Now the
 * rectangle is a photograph of the place, the clip arrives over the top of
 * it when it is ready, and a pilot who picks before then has still seen
 * what they picked.
 *
 * WHY IT IS RENDERED AND NOT DRAWN, the same argument as scripts/og.js: a
 * hand-made picture of a world drifts out of date the first time the world
 * changes, and nobody notices until somebody flies a town that does not look
 * like its card. This one is a frame of the real shell, rendered by the real
 * renderer through scripts/shots.js.
 *
 * THE CAMERAS BELOW ARE THE DESIGN. One per world, parked by hand, chosen so
 * that the frame reads as a PLACE at 340 px wide on a card: an establishing
 * three quarter with a horizon in it, from outside, far enough back that the
 * world's own landmark is in the shot. Not a corridor and not a wall two
 * metres away. That constraint is the whole brief, so the numbers live here
 * rather than in somebody's shell history, and each one says what it is
 * looking at.
 *
 * REGENERATE, DO NOT EDIT, the same rule as the icons and the share card:
 *
 *     npm run gen:posters                 # all four
 *     node scripts/posters.js city       # just this one
 *
 * A run takes minutes: it builds each world in headless Chromium at the
 * authored preset, one at a time.
