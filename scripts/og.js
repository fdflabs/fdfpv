/*
 * og.js: the share card, drawn by the thing it advertises.
 *
 * Every link to fdfpv.example posted anywhere renders a 1200 by 630 image, and
 * a made-up one would drift out of date the first time the world changed.
 * This one cannot: it is a frame of the real shell, rendered by the real
 * renderer, through scripts/shots.js, which is the same harness every
 * rendering bug in this project was found with.
 *
 * WHAT THE FRAME IS. The title screen on the race field, with the menu, the
 * chips and the body copy hidden so that only the wordmark and its subtitle
 * are left over the world. The camera is parked by hand at the numbers
 * below, off to the right of the course and low, so the lit start gate sits
 * centre with the parked quad in the near left and the flags and markers
 * running away behind it. Those numbers are the whole design: change them
 * and the card changes, so they live here rather than in somebody's shell
 * history.
 *
 * WHY THE MENU GOES AND THE WORDMARK STAYS. A share card is read at about
 * 500 px wide in a feed, next to a headline. The menu is six rows of text
 * that turn to mush at that size, and the paragraph about browser storage is
 * a sentence nobody reads twice. The wordmark survives the shrink, and it is
 * the one thing on the page that says which product this is.
 *
 * REGENERATE, DO NOT EDIT, the same rule as the icons:
 *
 *     npm run gen:og                                  # this repo
 *     node scripts/og.js . ../fdfpv-landing \
 *                          ../fdfpv-leaderboard/public
