/*
 * boardgif.js: draw the card animation for every room on a board that has
 * not got one, and upload it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The card animation is normally made by the
 * browser that publishes the room, seconds after the publish, by
 * src/share/cardgif.js. That covers every room published from now on and
 * none of the rooms published before it existed, whose authors' edit keys
 * are in browsers nobody still has. This is the one way to give those a
 * card, and it is why the board has a BOARD_ADMIN_TOKEN at all.
 *
 * WHY IT DRIVES A BROWSER. Same reason scripts/trackgif.js does, and it is
 * the same machinery: the scene is Three.js, Three.js is WebGL, this
 * project has no node_modules, and the bare three specifier resolves only
 * through a page's import map. So the render happens in Chromium through
 * src/trackbuilder/animate.html, which means the animation this writes and
 * the animation the builder writes come out of the same code.
 *
 * WHY ONLY ROOMS. A field track's plan is worth drawing and the board draws
 * it from the listing for nothing. A room is five metres across with three
 * gates in it, so its plan is an almost empty rectangle and the thing it
 * cannot show is the thing the track is made of. The board refuses an
 * animation for a field track anyway, in inspectGif, so this filters for
 * the same reason rather than for a different one.
 *
 * usage:
 *   BOARD_ADMIN_TOKEN=... node scripts/boardgif.js --board https://fdfpv.example/board
