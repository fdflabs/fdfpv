/*
 * ONE WORD FOR ONE THING.
 *
 * "Track" was a map id, a menu row, a screen title and a mode, and the same
 * object was a "course" on the board and in the builder's prose. The board's
 * own empty state used both nouns in one sentence. A player cannot be
 * expected to work out that the thing they built, the thing they published
 * and the thing they are racing are the same object when the product calls
 * it two things.
 *
 * The rename is done. This is what stops it coming back, because it will:
 * the next screen somebody adds will say "course" if nothing objects.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CHECKS, and what it deliberately does not.
 *
 * Player-visible text only: string literals that reach the DOM, and HTML
 * text nodes and rendering attributes. NOT identifiers, screen ids, CSS
 * class names, storage keys or API routes. `activeCourseSummary` and
 * `.course-card` are fine: nobody reads them but us, and renaming a stored
 * key would orphan every track already in somebody's browser.
 *
 * Comments are not checked either. They are for whoever is reading the
 * code, and a comment explaining why a key is still spelled `course` has to
 * be allowed to say the word.
