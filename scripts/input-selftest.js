/*
 * input-selftest.js: the calibration wizard and the stick mapping, driven in
 * plain Node against a synthetic radio, with one assertion per defect that
 * has already shipped once.
 *
 * Every check in here is a bug that reached the public board between the
 * 18th and the 21st of September 2026, was reproduced, fixed, and closed.
 * Each names its ticket. The probes that found them were written in a
 * scratch directory and died with the container, which is how a fix gets
 * to be un-fixed a month later by somebody tidying up. This file is those
 * probes, kept.
 *
 * TWO RULES, LEARNED THE HARD WAY IN THE SAME WEEK.
 *
 * The first is that a test written in the same sitting as the code inherits
 * the code's assumptions and can only confirm them. The review of the 19th
 * found three defects that the probes beside them could not see, because
 * every axis on the synthetic radio rested at 0 or -1 and swept
 * symmetrically, and every assertion was a band the raw arithmetic happened
 * to satisfy. So the radios here are deliberately awkward: yaw on axis 4
 * with a slider on axis 3, a throttle that springs to the middle, a stick
 * with its endpoints wound in to half travel, a pilot who obeys the prompt
 * and holds the throttle down. And the assertions are at the STOP, "full
 * stick reads exactly 1.0", rather than in a band.
 *
 * The second is that a latch must be tested in both directions. The no-yaw
 * warning was probed going false to true and never asked whether it could
 * come back, and it could not: a false positive stayed up for the rest of
 * the session. Every latch here is driven there and back.
 *
 * No browser. InputManager wants a window to hang key listeners on, a
 * localStorage and a navigator.getGamepads, and all three are shimmed at
 * the top of each rig so the class under test is the shipped one. The
 * browser half of the same regressions, the screens and the touch plates,
 * is scripts/input-check.js.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run input:selftest
