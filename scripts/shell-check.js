/*
 * shell-check.js: the first check that can see the menu shell.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Nothing in tests/ or scripts/ loaded index.html. Check 13
 * loads tests/browser/harness.html, which is 43 lines and does not import
 * the shell, and the only reference to src/ui/ui.js anywhere in either
 * directory was one SETTINGS_KEY import in shots.js. So a rewrite of ui.js
 * could break Escape on four screens, strand the cursor on the flight
 * controller list, and leave `npm run verify` reporting exactly what it
 * reported before. Every regression would have been found by a pilot.
 *
 * It is a cheap lint, not part of `npm run verify`, because verify builds
 * the WASM module and this has nothing to say about the flight model. Same
 * shape as lint:fc, lint:presets and lint:catalog: run it on a shell change
 * and it answers in about a minute.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, per screen:
 *
 *   reach   every item where isStop() is true is reachable from the first
 *           stop by SOME key: repeated ArrowDown, or Home then PageDown.
 *           Arrows alone is the wrong test, because arrows deliberately
 *           step over the 542 firmware keys this build does not implement.
 *           Reachable by some key is the property that actually matters.
 *   help    every stop that carries a note can be reached, because the help
 *           column is items[cursor].note and a row the cursor cannot hold
 *           is a row whose explanation is gone. On the flight controller
 *           that is 542 sentences, which is why the arrows skip them
 *           instead of the list dropping them.
 *   escape  Escape from the screen lands on a screen that exists.
 *   fit     the menu's scrollHeight minus its clientHeight, recorded as a
 *           budget rather than asserted at zero.
 *
 * THE BUDGETS ARE A BASELINE, NOT A TARGET. The title menu already overflows
 * on a short window and the project forbids moving a threshold to make a
 * check pass, so the recorded numbers are today's overflow. The check fails
 * when a screen gets WORSE than its baseline, and prints a note when one
 * gets better so the baseline can be re-recorded deliberately.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/shell-check.js               check against the baseline
 *   node scripts/shell-check.js --record      rewrite the baseline
 *   node scripts/shell-check.js --w=1280 --h=720
