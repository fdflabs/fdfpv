/*
 * micro-check.js: the RaceGOW class, end to end, in Node.
 *
 * Two halves, both cheap enough to run on any change that touches the
 * builder, the document, the course reader or the race.
 *
 * THE PIPELINE. Every element the micro palette offers is placed, sequenced,
 * written, read back, warned about, turned into a course and drawn as a
 * plan. It exists because the micro class threads a track class through nine
 * modules, and the failure mode of a threading bug is not an exception: it
 * is a full sized default arriving somewhere quiet, which looks like a room
 * with 5 ft gates in it and no error anywhere.
 *
 * THE RACE. The demo course is flown through the real Race object, gate by
 * gate along each gate's own travel axis, in the 5 mm steps a whoop at
 * 5 m/s produces at 1 kHz. It checks that a 45 mm scoring volume still
 * catches a gate that a full sized 500 mm one would have caught, that three
 * laps close, and that the RaceGOW metric, the fastest three consecutive,
 * is the sum of the three laps that were flown.
 *
 * The full sized class is run through the same pipeline in the same pass,
 * because half of what this file is for is proving the micro work did not
 * move the field.

 * EVERY SHIPPED ROOM, FLOWN ON THE LINE THE SOLVER ITSELF DERIVED.

 * raceDemo above flies a synthetic line built from each station's OWN
 * geometry: it goes to where the square is, whatever that is, and asks
 * whether a pass there scores. That is a real check and it is not this one.
 * It cannot see a station whose scoring volume is in the wrong PLACE,
 * because it moves the aircraft to the wrong place too and scores happily.
 *
 * This flies `course.line`, which is the racing line the builder derives and
 * paints, and asserts the lap completes. It is the end to end question a
 * pilot asks: if I fly the line you drew me, do I finish? Nothing else in
 * this repository asked it.
 *
 * WRITTEN FOR A DEFECT THAT REACHED THE SEAT. When the micro class started
 * building its world MICRO_SCALE times life size, virtualApertureDims kept
 * answering in the document's metres, so a pole's scoring square came out at
 * under a third of its size with its inner edge floating 0.86 m off the pole
 * instead of resting on it and its top at 1.48 m under a line that passes
 * above 2. Every one of the eight shipped tracks became impossible: three
 * laps became zero, and Track 1 stalled at station 4, which is its pole.
 * raceDemo stayed green throughout. The owner found it by flying it.
 *
 * So the assertion is the lap, on all eight, and the count of virtual
 * stations is printed because they are the ones that carry the risk: a real
 * opening is built from the structure it is cut into and a virtual one is
 * computed beside a pole.
