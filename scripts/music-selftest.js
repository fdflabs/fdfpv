/*
 * music-selftest.js: prove the bed plays the right crate at the right level.
 *
 * src/render/music.js now carries two crates on one media element and
 * swaps between them off the screen the player is looking at. That is a
 * state machine, and it is a state machine that runs entirely inside a
 * browser: an HTMLAudioElement, a MediaElementSource, a GainNode and a
 * fade scheduled against an AudioContext clock. Nothing in tests/ can see
 * any of it. Check 14 taps one key on the title screen and reads three
 * numbers, so it can tell you the bed is playing and cannot tell you
 * WHICH bed, at WHICH level, or whether a settings write in the menus
 * just cut the menu record off mid bar.
 *
 * The failures that shape has are all quiet ones:
 *
 *   the menu bed plays at the flight level, so the thing that was asked
 *     for as unobtrusive is the loudest thing on the title screen
 *   the flight crate plays in the menus, or the menu crate in flight
 *   a skip in the menus writes a menu id into the Music track setting,
 *     which is a list of flight ids, and the setting silently reverts
 *   a settings write in the menus reloads the element, so every stepper
 *     press on the Sound screen restarts the bed
 *   the swap never lands, because it waits on a tick that never comes
 *   the menu pick is a constant rather than a roll
 *
 * None of those would show up as an error anywhere. So this drives the
 * real class against a fake element and a fake context and asserts the
 * behaviour directly. It costs about a second and needs no browser.
