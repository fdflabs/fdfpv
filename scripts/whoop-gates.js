/*
 * whoop-gates.js: the flight envelope of SIM_AIRFRAME_WHOOP65, measured
 * against numbers that came from somewhere other than this repository.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT IN tests/. Every band in
 * tests/thresholds.json was fitted to the five inch: hover 0.20 to 0.30 at
 * thrust to weight 8.4, a 55 to 85 m punch, 30 to 40 m/s of terminal
 * velocity, a 0.15 m body. A 23 gram whoop fails six of those sixteen checks
 * by being a whoop, and tests/ is owned by the harness and must not be
 * edited to make a new airframe fit. So the whoop gets its own runner here,
 * in scripts/, where the rest of this project's measuring lives.
 *
 * THE BANDS ARE NOT FITTED TO THE MODEL. Each one names its source, and the
 * sources are outside this repository: the maker's published specification for
 * the whoop, thrust stand and review figures for the 0702 on 1S, the
 * ducted micro rotor literature for the figure of merit and the duct terms,
 * and RaceGOW's own leaderboards for what a lap actually takes. A gate that
 * fails is the plant being wrong, not the band.
 *
 * The five inch is measured too, in the same run, and the ONLY thing asserted
 * about it is that it did not move: the plant grew an airframe table for the
 * whoop's sake, and this is the cheap proof that doing so left the machine
 * every existing threshold was fitted against exactly where it was.
 *
 * Run it with `npm run whoop:gates`. It costs about a second.

   * A NOTE ON EVERYTHING ABOVE, AS OF THE MICRO SCALE CHANGE.
   *
   * W1 to W13 measure SIM_AIRFRAME_WHOOP65, and NOTHING IN THE SHELL SELECTS
   * IT ANY MORE: configs/airframes.js gives the whoop simId 0, the five
   * inch's plant, and the room it flies is built MICRO_SCALE times life size
   * to suit. The plant is still compiled in and every gate above still
   * passes, so this suite is now a check that a MODEL is what it claims
   * rather than a check on what a pilot flies.
   *
   * It is kept, and kept honest by saying so here, for two reasons. The whoop
   * plant is the record of what a 23 g 1S machine actually does and the
   * argument for the change rests on that record being right. And if the
   * decision is ever revisited, the gates that qualified it are the thing
   * that lets it be revisited cheaply.
   *
   * W15 is the exception and is live: it rests whatever plant the airframe
   * table selects, so it covers the five inch twice now and will follow the
   * whoop straight back if it ever changes plants again.

   * ---- W15 the parked height, both airframes ----

   * configs/airframes.js carries `vHalfDown` per aircraft, a snapshot of
   * plant.c's `hull_hz_down`, and src/main.js builds the whole ground frame
   * on it: the plane goes that far under the plant's origin, the craft
   * spawns there, and "is this the ground" is asked against it. A snapshot
   * that drifts from the plant puts the aircraft in the air or in the
   * floor, which is the defect this gate was written for: the shell used
   * the five inch's 45 mm for the whoop, which parks 10 mm up, so a whoop
   * sat 35 mm off the deck after every reset.
   *
   * So do not compare numbers, REST THE MODULE. Raise a plane exactly
   * vHalfDown under the origin, drop the craft on it with no throttle, and see
   * where it settles. If the snapshot is right the craft ends at z = 0,
   * where the shell draws it parked.
