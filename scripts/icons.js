/*
 * icons.js: draw the FDFPV mark and write the icon files a browser asks for.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT FOUR CHECKED IN BINARIES. An .ico is opaque:
 * once it is committed nobody can tell what it draws, what it was drawn from
 * or how to change the colour without a paint program and a guess. The mark
 * is four propellers, an X frame and a centre plate, which is about twenty
 * lines of arithmetic, so the geometry lives here as the one source of truth
 * and every file is derived from it. Change the mark in one place and rerun.
 *
 * WHY NO DEPENDENCY. Rasterising this needs signed distance fields and a box
 * filter, and encoding it needs zlib, which node already has. A PNG is a
 * length, a four letter tag, the bytes and a CRC, repeated three times. An
 * ICO is a six byte header, one sixteen byte directory entry per size and
 * the PNGs end to end. That is the whole format surface used here, so an
 * image library would be a few megabytes bought to avoid a hundred lines.
 *
 * ONE MARK, FOUR TINTS, and the tints are not decoration. A pilot ends up
 * with the simulator, the builder and the board open in three tabs at once,
 * and at sixteen pixels a tab is the icon plus four letters of title. Each
 * page's icon takes the accent that page itself is built out of, because the
 * icon is seen next to that page's title and above that page's colours:
 *
 *   sakura  the simulator, whose wordmark's FPV is sakura, 32 uses to mint's
 *           19, and which is the family's chrome colour everywhere else too
 *   amber   the track builder, where every armed tool, every selected object
 *           and every readout is amber
 *   mint    the board. Its own chrome is sakura, like the simulator's, and
 *           two identical icons defeat the whole point, so it takes mint,
 *           which is the colour it paints a record in
 *   cream   the landing page, the front door, which owns no product's accent
 *           and gets the other half of the wordmark
 *
 * THIS IS NOT THE MAPPING THE LANDING PAGE'S CARDS USE. Those are mint for
 * the simulator, sakura for the builder and amber for the board, which is a
 * different thing: a card sits in a row of three on one page and only has to
 * differ from its two neighbours, while an icon has to survive being looked
 * at beside the page it belongs to. Taking the cards' mapping would have put
 * a sakura icon on the amber page. Written down because the two mappings
 * disagree on every row and the next person will notice and wonder which is
 * wrong. Neither is. DEPLOY.md tabulates the same four and is the copy a
 * deploy is read from.
 *
 * WHAT IT WRITES, into the directory it is pointed at, with the names a
 * browser looks for on its own:
 *
 *   icon.svg              what every current browser uses, scales anywhere
 *   favicon.ico           16, 32 and 48, for the automatic /favicon.ico
 *   apple-touch-icon.png  180, for an iOS home screen
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/icons.js <accent> <outdir>
 *   npm run gen:icons          both sets inside this repo
 *
 * The board and the landing page are separate repositories and separate
 * static sites, so their sets are written across a checkout beside this one.
 * DEPLOY.md lists the four commands.
 *
 * THE OUTPUT IS COMMITTED AND NOTHING CHECKS IT, which is worth knowing
 * before trusting it. Change a number in the mark below without rerunning
 * this, and the site ships an SVG and a raster that draw different pictures
 * with no check failing, because none of the sixteen Stage 1 checks looks at
 * an icon. The pixels are deterministic; the FILES are not quite, because
 * the IDAT payload is whatever the linked zlib emits, so a Node upgrade that
 * moves the bundled zlib rewrites all eight files for a mark that did not
 * change. Neither is a reason to generate at deploy time: there is no build
 * step on any of the three services to generate in.
