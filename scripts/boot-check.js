/*
 * boot-check.js: the boot path's network shape, and the board's deadlines.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.
 *
 * DEPLOY.md says the free board sleeps after fifteen minutes and takes about
 * a minute to wake, and then says "The simulator is unaffected, because a
 * static site does not sleep". That sentence was true when it was written
 * and the code stopped it being true: main.js awaited two board round trips
 * before it asked for dist/sim.wasm, and the fetch behind them had no
 * deadline at all. Measured on a warm local board, the wasm request left the
 * browser at 1519 ms, after both. On a sleeping one it would not have left
 * for a minute, and the loading screen would have blamed the renderer.
 *
 * Nothing could catch that, because it is not a wrong value anywhere: it is
 * the ORDER of two correct calls, and the ABSENCE of a timeout. So this
 * check reads the module's own source for the shape rather than its output,
 * and drives the real functions against a server that never answers to prove
 * the deadline is enforced rather than merely written down.
 *
 * A source read is a weak test and this file knows it. It is here because
 * the alternative was no test: the strong version needs a browser, and the
 * two things being asserted are exactly the two that survive a browser check
 * passing.
