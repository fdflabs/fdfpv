/*
 * model.js: the track document. Creation, repair, and the JSON round trip.
 *
 * THE DOCUMENT IS THE DELIVERABLE. The simulator will read it one day and
 * this tool will not be in the room when it does, so the rules here are:
 * every field has one meaning, no field is derived from another field at
 * read time, and the file is readable by a person with no tooling. The
 * fields are documented one by one in schema.md next to a worked example.
 *
 * Two invariants the rest of the tool relies on:
 *
 *   normalize() ALWAYS returns a valid document. It never throws on bad
 *   input; it repairs what it can, drops what it cannot, and returns a list
 *   of what it did. Importing a file somebody hand edited must not be able
 *   to leave the tool in a state it cannot draw.
 *
 *   serialize() is STABLE. Keys are written in a fixed order and every
 *   number is rounded once, so export, import, export is byte identical and
 *   a saved track diffs cleanly.
 *
 * This module imports elements.js for defaults and geometry.js for the
 * aperture frame. It imports nothing else, and in particular nothing from
 * the simulator.
