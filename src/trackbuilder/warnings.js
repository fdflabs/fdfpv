/*
 * warnings.js: everything the results panel has to say about a track.
 *
 * WARNINGS ARE ADVISORY. Nothing in this file may stop a save, an export or
 * an edit. A course designer laying out a deliberately brutal split-S knows
 * more about it than a threshold does, and a tool that refuses to save is a
 * tool people stop using. Every warning names the element and, where it can,
 * the distance along the lap where the problem is, so it can be found.
 *
 * The five the task asks for, all present and each with its own code:
 *   no-face        an element with no entry face set
 *   reversal       two consecutive elements whose faces send the line backwards
 *   tight-corner   a radius of curvature under the track's threshold
 *   barrier        a path segment passing through a barrier
 *   out-of-field   the path leaving the field boundary
 *
 * Plus the ones a designer finds out about the hard way otherwise: an
 * element placed and never sequenced, a lap that does not close, two knots
 * on top of each other, and a line that goes underground.

 * THE POLES THAT ARE SOMEBODY'S LEG.
 *
 * RaceGOW builds much of its track by carrying one leg of a gate up past
 * the bar: the pipe above the bar is a pole and the pipe below it is the
 * gate's upright, one length of PVC on one fitting. The official Track 1,
 * Track 5 and Track 8 all do it, and two of them do it with a leg the lap
 * never flies around, which is simply the pipe that holds the opening over
 * the bar up.
 *
 * Such a pole is not a pole in the rules' sense and it is not a forgotten
 * element either, so the clearance rules and the unsequenced warning both
 * skip it. Anything standing further than half a pipe from a gate's own
 * frame line is a pole somebody put there, and every rule still holds it.

 * a warning that is always wrong is a warning nobody reads.
