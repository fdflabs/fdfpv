/*
 * path.js: Create Path. Turn the flying order into a racing line.
 *
 * The method, exactly as the tool implements it:
 *
 *   1. Walk the sequence. Each APERTURE contributes a knot at the opening's
 *      centre with a tangent equal to the aperture normal multiplied by the
 *      entry sign, so the tangent always points the way the quad is going.
 *   2. Each FLAG or CONE contributes a virtual knot offset from the marker
 *      by its clearance radius, perpendicular to the local direction of
 *      travel, on the chosen pass side. Its tangent is the local direction,
 *      because a marker has no plane of its own to take one from.
 *   3. If START PADS are placed the lap is a circuit, so a closing knot is
 *      appended at the FIRST sequenced element, same position and tangent.
 *      The pads are where the quad sits. They are not a hole and they do
 *      not belong on the racing line: drawing them in, then drawing the
 *      return to them, is the trail that looped around the grid.
 *   4. Fit a cubic Hermite between each consecutive pair, with both tangents
 *      scaled by settings.tangentScale multiplied by the straight line
 *      distance between that pair. One constant, in elements.js, tunable per
 *      track in doc.settings.
 *   5. Sample it, and carry arc length and curvature radius along.
 *
 * Curvature is computed from the analytic first and second derivatives of
 * the Hermite rather than from finite differences of the sampled polyline,
 * because a finite difference at this sample density reports a radius that
 * depends on the sample count, and a warning threshold that moves when you
 * change an unrelated setting is a warning nobody believes.

/*
 * WHICH WAY PAST A MARKER THE AUTHOR HAS TURNED BY HAND.
 *
 * A marker whose yaw is overridden has a fixed pass direction, so the line
 * runs square to it and all that is left to decide is the sign: one way
 * along the pass line or the other. The chain direction, next knot minus
 * previous knot, gets that wrong on a hairpin, and RaceGOW5 Track 8 is made
 * of hairpins round one tall pole: the lap leaves the tower going one way,
 * turns round beyond the pole, comes back past it the other way, and the
 * next opening is on the side it left from. Next minus previous is then
 * straight up the pole and says nothing, or points the way the lap is not
 * going.
 *
 * What decides it is where the quad IS when it sets off for the marker: the
 * previous knot plus a step along that knot's own tangent. From there the
 * marker is either ahead along the pass line or behind it. The step is the
 * marker's own clearance, and it is that short on purpose: it only has to
 * break the tie when the marker stands dead abeam of the previous knot, and
 * a longer one, a body length say, overshoots a pole one lattice unit
 * along and answers the other way. A marker still square across the line
 * after the step keeps the chain's answer, as does the first knot of a
 * track with no pads.
