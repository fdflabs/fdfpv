/*
 * app.js: the track builder itself. State, keyboard, top bar, and the wiring
 * between the two views and the panels.
 *
 * This module is the ONLY thing in the track builder that holds mutable
 * state, and everything that changes the document goes through edit(), which
 * takes the undo snapshot, runs the mutation, re-derives the faces, clamps
 * the sequence, rebuilds the line if one is showing, refreshes the panels and
 * schedules an autosave. One door in, so no edit can arrive without an undo
 * step or leave a stale racing line behind it.
 *
 * ISOLATION. Nothing here imports from the simulator: not the physics, not
 * the flight controller, not the renderer, not the input path, not the game
 * state. The only thing this tool shares with the game is the track document
 * described in schema.md, and the game does not read it yet.

/*
 * WHICH KIND OF TRACK A NEW ONE IS.
 *
 * A track class is a property of the track, so it has to be decided when a
 * NEW one is made, and the honest source for that decision is which aircraft
 * the pilot has seated: a 65 mm whoop flies a RaceGOW room and a 5 inch
 * flies a sixty metre field.
 *
 * Three sources, in order:
 *
 *   ?class=micro   an explicit answer in the URL. None of the simulator's
 *                  own links carry one; this is for a hand typed address.
 *   the settings   the shell's own blob, read as a STRING KEY rather than by
 *                  importing anything from it. The builder does not import a
 *                  line of the simulator (see schema.md) and this keeps that
 *                  true: the coupling is one localStorage key and one field
 *                  name, both named here, and a change to either shows up as
 *                  the builder defaulting to a field, which is the safe way
 *                  round.
 *   'full'         nobody said, so it is the track this tool has always made.
 *
 * Note what is NOT here: an existing document's own class always wins, and
 * this function is never consulted for one. Opening a RaceGOW track on a 5
 * inch shows you a RaceGOW track.

  /*
   * The pictures this course is dressed in: up to five of them.
   *
   * A dialog rather than a field in the inspector, and the reason is what
   * they belong to: a logo is a property of the TRACK, not of any element on
   * it, so putting them beside a gate's dimensions would say the opposite.
   * The inspector's Field section is the other candidate and it is where a
   * field width lives, but that panel is only reachable with nothing
   * selected, which is not where somebody who has just placed ten gates is.
   *
   * FIVE SLOTS, NUMBERED, and the numbers are load bearing. Gate 1 wears
   * logo 1, gate 2 logo 2, round and round, so fifteen gates share five
   * sponsors three apiece; the inspector's picker for a painted footprint
   * counts in the same numbers; and the line under the list says what that
   * works out as for THIS course rather than leaving an author to divide.
   *
   * THE PREVIEWS ARE THE POINT OF THE DIALOG. Uploading an image and then
   * having to load a world to find out it came out square, or too small to
   * read, or half off the board, is the version of this feature nobody would
   * use twice. Each slot shows the gate header it lands on and the grass it
   * lands on, because those are two different shapes and a logo can suit one
   * and not the other.
   *
   * PAINT ON THE GRASS IS A BUTTON HERE, and it is here because it was
   * nowhere. Putting a logo on the turf meant knowing that the palette's
   * Ground logo was the thing that did it, which is a name you only
   * recognise once somebody has told you. The grass preview sitting in this
   * dialog beside every logo made that worse rather than better: it showed
   * an author what paint would look like and then left them no way to ask
   * for any. The button arms the same palette tool with this logo already
   * chosen, so the next click on the field is the decal.
