/*
 * stage.js: the track as a lit object on a black floor, for the animation
 * export and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT src/render/scene.js. That file already builds gates out of
 * pipe with a moulded fitting at every corner, and it already has a dark
 * branch for a micro track, so it looks at first like the obvious base. It is
 * not. The micro branch is a room: pine board walls, an OSB ceiling with
 * joists, a mat with a concrete border and a skirting board, built
 * unconditionally with no way to ask for the object without the room, and a
 * three quarter view from above of a track in it is a view of a ceiling.
 * scene.js also exports four functions, none of which is a gate builder, so
 * the pipe geometry cannot be borrowed without traversing a built world by
 * guesswork. The RaceGOW element set is gates, stacks, ladders, towers, dive
 * gates and poles, every one of which is a pipe frame or a single pipe, so
 * building them here from the same maths the builder already uses is smaller
 * than reaching into a world for them.
 *
 * WHY NOT view3d.js EITHER. It draws a gate as four boxes with two square
 * legs, no fittings, no feet and no shadows, because it is an editor preview
 * where the reading is what matters and a joint is noise.
 *
 * WHAT IS SHARED, and it is the part that matters: every number here comes
 * from the builder's own DOM free maths, apertureFrame, apertureCorners,
 * apertureCenter, aperturesOf and gateSupportFeet. The pipe this draws stands
 * exactly where the builder says the gate is, because it is asking the same
 * functions the builder asks.
 *
 * THE FRAME. Everything below is authored in DOCUMENT coordinates, right
 * handed and Z up, under one root group rotated minus a quarter turn about X
 * so Three sees its own Y up world. That conversion happens once, here, the
 * same way view3d.js does it, and nowhere else in this file.

 * half the gates behind the other half.
 *
 * ELEVATION. Looking down 40 degrees. Lower and the gates overlap; higher
 * and it becomes a plan view, which the builder already draws better.
 *
 * FOV. Thirty degrees vertical, which is a long lens. This is the single
 * number that makes the picture read as a drawing of a track rather than a
 * photograph of one: perspective convergence across a 10 m room at 30
 * degrees is small enough that the gates stay comparable, which is the whole
 * point of looking at a course.
 *
 * MARGIN. Six percent on top of an exact fit. The fit below is exact
 * because it projects the real vertices, so this only has to keep the
 * outermost pipe off the edge of a frame somebody will see cropped square.
 *
 * AIM_HEIGHT. The camera aims a third of the way up rather than at the
 * middle, which leaves the lower part of the frame for the name.

 * THE PACE OF THE LAP IS A SPEED, NOT A DURATION.

 * is 41.5 m and flew at 3.5 m/s, Track 1 is 13.4 m and crawled at 1.1 m/s.
 * The pilot's report is exactly that. "If there are many gates the pathing
 * moves very fast, if a few gates slow."
 *
 * RaceGOW'S OWN ANIMATIONS ARE THE ANSWER AND THEY WERE MEASURED. The three
 * official files are 288, 192 and 96 frames, all at 42 ms, which is 12, 8
 * and 4 seconds for laps of 41.47, 34.63 and 13.38 m. That is 3.46, 4.33
 * and 3.35 m/s, one pace picked per track and quantised to whole four
 * second blocks: 89.48 m over 24.0 s, 3.73 m/s.
 *
 * The five inch's figure is that speed scaled by the ratio of the two
 * aircraft's swept radii, 0.1735 over 0.0506, because a machine three and a
 * half times the size has to cover three and a half times the ground to
 * read as the same pace to an eye. It comes out at 12.7 m/s, which is
 * inside the 12 to 15 m/s a five inch actually laps a 400 m course at, and
 * that agreement is the check on the reasoning rather than the reasoning
 * itself.
 *
 * src/share/plan.js carries the same two numbers for the course card, with
 * the same note, so a card and a GIF of one track still move together.

 * against a DOCUMENT length is the field's 12.7 divided by 3.4289, which is
 * 3.704. The measured figure and the derived one agree to 0.7 percent.
 *
 * That agreement is worth writing down rather than acting on. It is evidence
 * that the scale is the right size: a real whoop's lap pace in a real room
