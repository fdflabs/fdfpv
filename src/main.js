/*
 * main.js: the shell. Loads dist/sim.wasm, feeds it timestamped stick
 * samples, steps it on a fixed 1 kHz accumulator driven by
 * requestAnimationFrame, renders an interpolated view, and drives the
 * product shell in src/ui/ui.js. The frame delta clocks the accumulator
 * and never reaches the integrator; a dropped frame changes nothing about
 * the trajectory.
 *
 * The page opens on a title: the loaded map fills the canvas, the session
 * airframe flies the map's attract line, and the menu sits on top as a
 * HUD. That shot is the same world the player is about to fly, not a
 * second scene. Settings still has its own cheap studio context, created
 * when that screen opens and torn down when flight starts.
 *
 * Ground handling is shell side: the physics module has no ground plane
 * (the verification harness measures free air behaviour), so the shell
 * raises sim_set_ground and the plant applies a rigid-body contact every
 * 1 ms step. Grass is a dead thump with a short belly slide. Turtle is
 * a scripted recovery: inverted, seated and still shows TURTLE MODE, and
 * any pitch or roll poke flips the hull upright. Hits bounce. The one
 * exception is a clip-through or a leftover overlap bounce cannot leave:
 * the shell freezes, says Crashed, and puts the quad back on the line.
 * See PROGRESS.md.
 *
 * Keys in flight: Escape pauses, R returns to the start line, L is launch
 * control when that setting is on, F steps the flaps of an aircraft that
 * has them, F3 toggles the performance readout, F8 reports a bug.
 * Everything else is a menu choice.
 * Sticks: radio in joystick mode (Gamepad API) or WASD plus arrows.
 * Drop a Betaflight diff file onto the page to fly your own config.

   * PUT THE CRAFT BACK WHERE IT WAS AFTER A CONFIG SWAP, instead of putting
   * the run back on the start line.
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS. Rates are part of the config text, so changing one has
   * to go through sim_init, and sim_init is a full reset: "dynamic state
   * zeroed as in sim_reset", per src/native/sim_abi.h. Every rate change
   * therefore used to end in reset(), which zeroes the LAP clock and drops
   * the quad on the start line. That is right for a tune, which changes the
   * machine, and wrong for rates, which change the pilot: the owner asked
   * for a rate change mid run to leave the run alone, and a pilot tuning
   * stick feel against a corner cannot do it if every nudge costs the lap.
   *
   * WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT CARRY. Position and attitude go back through
   * sim_set_pose, which is the only writer the ABI exposes. VELOCITY,
   * ANGULAR RATE AND MOTOR RPM CANNOT FOLLOW: sim_init zeroes them, no
   * export writes them, and this container has no Emscripten to add one. So
   * the quad resumes stationary where it was rather than carrying its
   * momentum through. That is the honest limit of this change and it is
   * nearly invisible in the path the request describes, where the pilot is
   * on the pause menu and the craft is holding still anyway.
   *
   * WHAT HAS TO BE PUT BACK BY HAND is what sim_init wiped and the shell
   * still believes: the pack, and crashflip. The airframe and the flight
   * style are MODES and survive init by ABI contract; the ground plane is
   * written every frame by the contact loop; angle mode is re-applied by
   * syncAngleMode at the tail of applySettings, which runs after this.
   *
   * The RC grid is re-pinned and the queue dropped for the same reason
   * resetCraft does it: the module's step index went back to zero, and a
   * stick sample stamped on the old clock would land in the integrator's
   * future.

   * never been able to reach it: setCrashflip(true) starts the SCRIPTED

   * TURTLE_RATE). Wedged on its side, or winding itself up against a

   * had was closed exactly where it was needed. That is the second half
   * of the owner's "i can't turtle out nor can i right it".
   *
   * So this is the real thing, on a held key: the mixer path from
   * mixer.c, driven by the pitch and roll sticks, spinning the high
   * motors to walk the machine out of wherever it is. It is not a
   * scripted animation and it does not choose an attitude for you; it is
   * the same control a pilot has on a real quad, and like the real one it
   * does nothing useful in the air.
   *
   * The scripted turtle keeps the ground it already holds: while a wait

   * The sound was a two-way switch, 'crash' over 18 m/s and 'clip' under
   * it, with everything below 4 m/s silent. As the only channel left that
   * is a poor instrument: a gate brush and a wall at speed picked one of
   * two samples. It is continuous now, from the same number the physics
   * used, so a hard hit sounds hard.
   *
   * The camera did nothing at all. There was no impact kick anywhere in
   * the shell: makeLensShake reads rotor speed and nothing else. A real
   * hit throws the whole airframe, and the FPV camera is bolted to it, so
   * the picture moves. That is `impactKick`, decayed per frame and added
   * to the lens shake where it already lands on the camera.
   *
   * And the blades: a spinning 5 inch that meets a wall does not carry
   * its rotor speed through the contact. sim_prop_strike takes it out, so
   * a wall tap costs a beat of thrust and the pilot feels the sag while
   * the motors spin back up. That is a physics consequence rather than an
   * effect, which is why it is here and not in the renderer.

   * normal, and threeDirToSim is the basis PERMUTATION and nothing else. A
   * permutation cannot undo a rotation.
   *
   * On a level floor that costs nothing, because a yaw about world up leaves
   * a vertical normal alone, which is exactly why this survived: the ground
   * model, the roof test and the race field all read straight. On a VERTICAL
   * face it is the whole answer. Measured through this chain, a craft flying
   * at 10 m/s square into a wall, with the plant's own velocity beside the
   * normal the plant was handed:
   *

   *   spawn yaw   90 deg   n . v   -0.0   PERPENDICULAR: a head on hit reads
   *                                       as a graze along the face
   *   spawn yaw  180 deg   n . v  +10.0   REVERSED: contact_impulse sees a
   *                                       craft leaving and declines it
   *
   * The freestyle city spawns at yaw pi (src/maps/city/index.js), so every

   * impulse when vn >= 0 and there is no penetration to push out of, so a
   * wall tap in the town got no restitution, no friction and no separation:
   * the sweep parked the hull 8 mm off the face, the pass broke out on a
   * zero impulse and threw away the tangential travel with it, and the craft
   * sat on the wall. That is the owner's report, and it is a frame error
   * rather than a friction one, which is why walking the materials never
   * fixed it.
   *
   * raiseGroundFromState already carried the fix for the ground plane, with

   *
   * THIS USED TO RUN ONCE PER RENDERED FRAME, ON THE INTERPOLATED RENDER
   * POSE, AND WRITE THE RESULT BACK INTO THE PLANT. Three things followed
   * from that and all three were felt:
   *
   *   1. the trajectory depended on the frame rate, which CLAUDE.md
   *      forbids in as many words: a dropped frame must change nothing.
   *      Two machines at 60 and 144 fps took different lines off the same
   *      wall, and the leaderboard is scored on that.
   *   2. the pose it solved against was a lerp between two physics states,
   *      so the contact was never resolved against a state the plant had
   *      actually been in.
   *   3. a contact rewound the craft to the touch point and threw away
   *      the rest of the frame's travel, INCLUDING the part along the
   *      surface. In sustained contact hitT is 0 every frame, so the craft
   *      was put back where it started, every frame, and could not slide.
   *      That is the "it sticks a bit" in the owner's report, and it is
   *      not a friction problem: there was no tangential motion left to
   *      apply friction to.
   *
   * So it runs here instead, every OBSTACLE_STEP milliseconds of SIM time,
   * against the plant's own pose, and the leftover travel is projected
   * onto the face and swept again rather than dropped. The cadence is a
   * count of 1 ms steps, so it is identical however the host batched them.
   *
   * Collide and slide, four passes: hit, place on the face, impulse there,
   * carry the remaining travel along the surface, sweep that too. Four is
   * enough for a corner (two faces) with slack; anything still overlapping
   * after that is what the clip watch reads.
