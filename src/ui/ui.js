/*
 * ui.js: the product shell. Title, how to fly, credits, settings, pause,
 * results, stick calibration, the flight overlay, and the flight-controller screen.
 *
 * Why this exists: the page used to load straight into a falling quad with
 * a monospace debug dump in the corner. That reads as a tech demo. A
 * player arriving cold needs a title to land on, a way to start, a way to
 * learn the sticks, a way to change the few settings that matter, and a
 * result to read at the end of a run.
 *
 * Every screen is navigable from the keyboard alone and from a radio or
 * gamepad alone, except Settings and the title. On a radio there are no
 * reliable menu buttons, so the sticks drive the other menus: pitch moves
 * the cursor, roll right selects, roll left goes back. Any gamepad button
 * also selects. Title and Settings keep the sticks for the airframe, so
 * those screens are mouse and keyboard for the rows. A radio switch still
 * selects on the title. The screens say so. Rows that hold a value also
 * have a mouse control: up and down arrows for a stepped number, a
 * dropdown for a named list.
 *
 * The DOM is built here rather than in index.html so the markup and the
 * state machine that drives it sit in one file. Styling lives in
 * index.html next to the rest of the page's CSS.
 *
 * Nothing in this file touches the simulation. It reads state that the
 * shell hands it and returns the player's intent as action strings.

 * hands sim_set_gravity before a pilot touches anything.
 *
 * THIS IS THE THIRD SHAPE OF ONE SLIDER, and each step was a pilot's.
 * First it scaled drag, and the pilot said the difference was hardly
 * discernible. Then it scaled gravity from 70 to 180 percent of 1.0, and the
 * same pilot flew it to the stop and said full Sinky feels about right, then
 * asked for normal to sit at ninety percent of that with headroom either way.
 * So 0.9 times 1.80 is the base, the slider is 60 to 140 around it, and the
 * number a pilot reads is a weight rather than a gravity: "Weight 120" is
 * twenty percent heavier than the machine we ship, whatever the base is.
 *
 * Sinky is not planted. Planted is HORIZONTAL, how far the craft carries.
 * Sinky is VERTICAL, how fast it comes down and how little it hangs, and the
 * drag slider moved the vertical axis by single figures while moving the
 * fall time the wrong way. Gravity moves it fivefold; measured at the base:
 *
 *   weight 60    0.97 g   hover 26.0, fall 10 m 1.57 s, balloon 4.03 m
 *   weight 100   1.62 g   hover 35.0, fall 10 m 1.20 s, balloon 1.62 m
 *   weight 140   2.27 g   hover 42.7, fall 10 m 1.01 s, balloon 0.67 m
 *
 * The floaty end is within half a percent of the 1.0 machine every earlier
 * record was set on, which is deliberate: a pilot who liked the old feel can
 * have it back. The sinky end is heavier than anyone has yet asked for.
 *
 * What it costs, said plainly: scaling gravity is a heavier world rather
 * than a heavier quad. At the base the craft carries 1.62 times the thrust
 * at hover, so every tilt shoves it sideways that much harder, 5.5 to 8.8
 * m/s2 at the same 57 degree bank, where a real heavy quad accelerates at
 * g tan theta whatever it weighs. Rotation is untouched within 1.5 percent.
 * The pilot flew that and called it right; if a later report says it turns
 * too hard, the answer is mass, not this band.

/*
 * THE THREE WAYS IN, and they are the whole of the front door.
 *
 * This used to be two questions in a row. Which aircraft, five inch or
 * whoop, and then race or freestyle, and the second one was skipped on the
 * whoop because a 65 mm machine has nowhere to freestyle. So a pilot who
 * came to fly pressed twice, and what the second press asked depended on
 * what the first one answered: choosing the five inch produced a question
 * the whoop had not been asked. The owner reported exactly that, and it is
 * the report this table answers.
 *
 * Between the two questions there are three legal answers and no more. The
 * whoop has no freestyle, so the pairs are five inch racing, whoop racing,
 * and freestyle, which is the five inch. One screen, three cards, one press.
 * The objection the old aircraft gate wrote down was that a third card
 * beside Race and Freestyle would pretend racing on a whoop was not a real
 * answer; it is answered by racing on a whoop being one of the three cards
 * rather than by asking twice.
 *
 * A card carries both halves of the answer, so act() seats the aircraft and
 * sets the mode in one go. The AIRCRAFT is remembered in settings and the
 * MODE deliberately is not, which is unchanged: what the cursor opens on is
 * the seated aircraft's card, and every visit still passes through here.
 *
 * The pictures are frames of the real renderer, shipped as files by
 * scripts/gatecards.js, because the screen a first visit opens on has to
 * paint before anything has been flown and with no network. The plan
 * drawing over each one is craftSvg, and the two machines are drawn to ONE
 * scale in one viewBox, so the whoop is a fifth of the width of the five
 * inch on its card because it is a fifth of the width of it on a bench. A
 * photograph of a room and a photograph of a field cannot say that: they
 * are both a picture that fills a card.

   * form's own error line instead of vanishing behind a confirmation.
   * Discard is the only path that loses anything and it takes a
   * deliberate click on a button that says so.
   *
   * An untouched form closes silently. Asking somebody who typed nothing
   * whether they really meant it is how a guard teaches people to click
   * through guards without reading them.

       * note, the wiki teaser and the best-lap chip off a screen that is
       * asking one question, and the rule that hides an empty menu panel.

   * `mode` is 'race' or 'freestyle', and it is not a cosmetic switch: a
   * freestyle map has no gates, no lap and no record, so a HUD that showed
   * "Gate 1 of 0" and a lap clock counting from a line that does not exist
   * would be reporting three things that are not true. What it shows instead
   * is what a freestyle pilot actually reads.
   *
   *   THE RUN CLOCK, not a lap and no longer an airtime. It was an airtime,
   *   counting up, on the reasoning that freestyle is flown in packs and how
   *   long you have been up decides when to come home. That was right while
   *   nothing was being measured. A freestyle run is two minutes now, with a
   *   score at the end of it that goes on a public board, so the number a
   *   pilot needs is how much of it is LEFT: the last twenty seconds are when
   *   they decide whether to try the big line, and they cannot decide that
   *   without knowing they are the last twenty seconds.
   *
   *   It is in the lap clock's slot, top centre, rather than beside the
   *   score. That is where a pilot already looks for a clock, and it means
   *   there is exactly ONE clock on the screen: an airtime counting up
   *   beside a run counting down is two answers to the same question.
   *   ALTITUDE ABOVE THE GROUND UNDER THE CRAFT. This one is not optional in
   *   a city. Cross one street and the surface under you moves seven metres,
   *   from the road to the overbridge deck; a height measured from the spawn,
   *   which is what this used to show, is a number that means nothing over a
   *   roof. The shell measures it against the surface query the collision
   *   test uses, so the readout and the thing that kills you agree.
   *   Speed, pack and throttle are the same in both, because they are
   *   properties of the machine and not of the game around it.

     * THE KEYBOARD'S RULE, WHICH THE STICKS DID NOT HAVE.
     *
     * Left and Right on a card screen MOVE the cursor, they do not adjust
     * the row under it: the cards lie in a row and that is what a player
     * reaches for. See the arrow keys above, whose reason for it was that
     * nothing on a card screen has a value to adjust. That stopped being
     * true when the Freestyle room grew a Scoring row and a Physics model
     * row, and with one freestyle world the room draws no cards at all, so
     * Scoring is the FIRST row and the cursor opens on it.
     *
     * On the sticks that made roll LEFT, which everywhere else in the
     * product is BACK, step Scoring backwards instead. cycle() wraps, so
     * one nudge of the gesture a radio pilot uses to leave a room took the
     * default 'off' the long way round to 'scored', and writeSettings
     * saved it: an unfinished scorer switched on, a two minute clock and a
     * public board, for a pilot who thought they had pressed Escape and
     * has no memory of asking for any of it. Roll right was the same bug
     * one position milder, and the hint under the screen tells a radio
     * pilot to roll. See DEFAULTS.freestyleScoring for why off is what a
     * pilot gets without asking.
     *
     * So the sticks get the keyboard's rule. On a card screen roll right
     * chooses and roll left goes back, which is what the hint promises,
     * and a segmented row is still reachable from a radio because select
     * cycles it: see the segmented branch in select().
