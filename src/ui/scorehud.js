/*
 * scorehud.js: the freestyle score, on the screen, the way Tony Hawk does it.
 *
 * THE THING BEING COPIED, precisely, because "like Tony Hawk" is not a
 * specification. THPS puts four separate readouts on screen and each one
 * does a different job:
 *
 *   1. The running total, top left, permanent, and it only ever goes up.
 *   2. The trick name, shouted the instant the trick is recognised, one
 *      line per trick, stacking upward and fading out on its own.
 *   3. The live combo: the points in the chain and the multiplier they will
 *      be worth, sitting under the names, redrawn every frame so the number
 *      climbs while you are still flying.
 *   4. The verdict. The combo line either banks, and the number flies into
 *      the total, or it BAILS in red and the number goes to nothing.
 *
 * Number 4 is the one that matters. A score that only counts up is a
 * counter. A score that can be lost in front of you is a game, and the whole
 * reason the combo is drawn separately from the total is so that the pilot
 * can see exactly how much is at risk before they decide to try one more
 * thing.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS. Down the left, because the existing flight OSD has the top
 * centre (lap clock), both bottom corners (pack and speed) and the bottom
 * centre (the stick ghost). The left column between the top and the bottom
 * corner is the only run of screen this can have without covering something
 * a pilot is already reading, and it happens to be where THPS puts it.
 *
 * NO ANIMATION LOOP. Everything that moves is a CSS keyframe on a node that
 * removes itself when the animation ends. This file never asks for a frame,
 * never holds a timer that outlives the run, and does no work at all on a
 * frame where nothing changed except the combo bar, because a rAF driven
 * overlay competing with the render loop is how a smooth sim gets a stutter
 * that nobody can find.
