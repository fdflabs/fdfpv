/*
 * build-cost.js: how long each map takes to build, measured.
 *
 * It is its own file for one reason: src/boot.js needs the number BEFORE it
 * imports anything else, so the loading screen's stage weights are right from
 * the first frame, and importing src/maps/registry.js there would be fine
 * today and a trap tomorrow. The registry's whole job is to hold the two
 * loader thunks, and the day somebody turns one of those dynamic imports into
 * a static one the city's 59 file graph would arrive at boot for every
 * player, which is exactly what deliverable 4 forbids. A file with two
 * numbers in it cannot do that.
 *
 * Measured on this container at 1280 by 720 across three runs. The city's
 * world build was 7554, 7646 and 8782 ms; the field's 2886 and 3042. These
 * are weights for a progress bar, so the spread does not matter much, but
 * replace them with a re-measurement rather than a guess.
