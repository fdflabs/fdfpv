/*
 * references.js: measuring the town against things that have a real size.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. This project has shipped a scale error before, and every
 * number in its cost ledger stayed correct while it did: grass blades were
 * 0.26 to 0.68 m, which made a 1.524 m regulation gate vanish from frame, and
 * nothing in the harness noticed because nothing in the harness knew how tall
 * a blade of grass is. A budget cannot catch a scale error. Only a reference
 * object can.
 *
 * The trap here is the opposite of the grass one. The town is authored for a
 * walker with a 1.7 m eye, so everything in it is correctly sized for a
 * person and therefore genuinely enormous next to a 0.220 m quad. A doorway
 * that is four times the craft's width is not a bug, it is a doorway. So
 * these measurements hunt for what is ABSOLUTELY wrong, against sizes a tape
 * measure would give in a real Japanese suburb, and not for what merely looks
 * big from a quad's camera.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER HERE IS MEASURED FROM THE BUILT WORLD, NOT READ OFF A
 * CONSTANT. A constant that agrees with itself proves nothing. The kerb comes
 * from the town's own height query, so it is the surface the craft will
 * actually land on; the handrail comes from the collider list, so it is the
 * thing the craft will actually hit; the doorway comes from the geometry, so
 * it is what is drawn. If any of the three drifted from the others the check
 * would catch it, which a shared constant could not.
 *
 * This must run BEFORE src/maps/city/bake.js, because the merge applies each
 * instance's matrix into its vertices and a merged door is anonymous floats.
