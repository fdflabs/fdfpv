/*
 * city.js: the freestyle map. A whole Japanese suburban railway crossing
 * town, vendored from sakura-crossing under MIT and flown rather than walked.
 *
 * WHAT IS OURS AND WHAT IS THEIRS. Everything under ./vendored/ is Kenton
 * Wang's, MIT, and stays that way: see /NOTICE and ./vendored/LICENSE. This
 * file is ours, GPLv3, and it is the whole of the join. It builds the town,
 * lights it, gives it a contact model a quad can crash into, and drives its
 * one moving part from the physics clock instead of from frame time.
 *
 * THE FLAT AUTHORING IS TAKEN, THE PLANET IS NOT. The town is authored on a
 * flat plane and its own source says so at the bake call site: "Everything
 * above this line is still authored on a flat plane and has no idea the
 * planet exists". `bakeToPlanet` is a pure post pass over the object graph,
 * so it is a choice. We decline it, for two reasons that both matter.
 *
 *   1. Our physics is right handed Z up and the conversion to three.js Y up
 *      happens exactly once, in src/render/frame.js. A sphere of radius 160 m
 *      compresses x by cos(z / R), which is 0.37 at z = -190, and no single
 *      conversion can express that. Taking the flat authoring means the town
 *      drops into our space with NO transform and frame.js is not touched.
 *   2. The bake bends every mesh onto a 160 m sphere, which gives every one
 *      of them a bounding sphere the size of the planet, which disables
 *      frustum culling for the whole world. Measured both ways in this file's
 *      round of PROGRESS.md.
 *
 * The cost is the curved horizon, which is a look rather than a feature, and
 * the town's x wrap, which a quad has no reason to reach.

 * The title screen's flythrough.
 *
 * THE OLD SHOT FLEW THROUGH THE BUILDINGS. It was an 11 m circle round the
 * spawn at 3.2 m, and the spawn is in the middle of a 6.3 m carriageway
 * with shopfronts hard against both footways, so two thirds of every
 * revolution was spent inside somebody's front room. A circle drawn on a
 * street plan does not know there are buildings on it.
 *
 * So the camera flies the ROAD. `centerX(z)` is the same centreline every
 * builder in the town placed itself against, which is what makes this
 * clearance a property of the layout rather than a value somebody tuned by
 * flying it: the carriageway is 6.3 m wide and empty by construction, and
 * anything at street level that is not empty, the crossing, the traffic,
 * the poles, stands off it.
 *
 * Up the street at 3.3 m, over the railway, then out and back over the
 * roofs, which is a lap of the district rather than a lap of one junction
 * and reads as a place rather than as a diorama.
 *
 * THE HOP OVER THE CROSSING IS NOT DECORATION. A train car's roof is at
 * 3.96 m and its pantograph reaches higher, the contact wire is at 4.88 and
 * the messenger at 5.95 (railway.js), so between the road and the wires
 * there is NO height that clears a train. 6.9 m at the crossing is over the
 * messenger with most of a metre to spare, and the district's tallest thing
 * anywhere near the road is a 9.2 m utility pole standing beside it.

 * along the bottom edge. But the height query answers with the walkable

 * sugi in this town is 10.6 m of trunk before its own scale factor, up to
 * about 12.5 m.

 * the north end, and the school has cedars in it. The height query answers
 * with the walkable SURFACE, so a camera told to stay 8 m over the ground
 * flew straight through a canopy, twice, at two different heights. There is
 * no height between the road and the treetops that is safe out there.
 *
 * So the climb moves onto the LAST STRETCH OF ROAD instead. The carriageway
 * is empty by construction, its poles stand beside it and its wires run
 * along it, so a camera rising over the middle of it passes nothing. By the
 * time the turn begins the shot is already at roof height and the turn is
 * flat. The descent at the other end is the same thing mirrored.
 *
 * HOW LONG THE CLIMB IS, is a question about the FRAME rather than about
 * clearance. The camera looks lookAhead metres down the line, so on a ramp
 * it is pointed down the ramp: 15.7 m of height over 24 m of road is a
 * gradient of 0.65, and 0.65 plus the aim drop is forty degrees of nose
 * down. Forty degrees at roof height is a photograph of tarmac, which is
 * what the return leg's cards looked like and were reported as. Thirty two

 * Fog and far plane.
 *
 * The town's own values are a fog of 44 to 205 m and a far plane of 600, set
 * for a walker with a 1.7 m eye whose sight lines are down streets. A quad
 * climbs, and from 60 m up the whole district is inside one frustum, so the
 * far plane has to hold the far side of the town and the fog has to not eat
 * it.
 *
 * THE FOG IS WHAT MAKES THE CULL INVISIBLE, so it is set from CULL_RADIUS
 * rather than chosen for itself. Anything switched off at the radius has to
 * already be the fog's colour when it goes, or the cull is a pop instead of a
 * cull, and that means FOG_FAR at or inside the radius rather than past it.
 * It was 135 against a radius of 145, which held; cutting the radius to 100
 * without moving the fog would have left a 35 m band where the town winks out
 * in clear air.
 *
 * HOW SHORT IS SET BY THE FLYING, NOT BY THE FRAME. 65 m of fog at 100 km/h is
 * 2.3 s of sight, which is enough to read a gap and commit to it. The sweep
 * kept paying below that, 1153 draw calls at the worst view for a radius of 50
 * against 1236 for 70, and 45 m of fog is 1.6 s, which is being asked to
 * commit to a line before it exists. 83 draw calls is not worth flying blind,
 * so this stops at the last value a pilot can use rather than at the last one
 * the ledger likes.
 *
 * The far plane stays long. It costs nothing, it is depth precision rather
 * than draw calls, and the sky dome and the hills behind the town live out
 * there.
 *
 * High's live numbers (fog 22 to 65, cull 70, foliage keep 0.65, shadow
 * half 22) live in src/render/quality.js so Medium and Low can scale them
 * without a second copy of the reasoning.

 * Distance past which a district's contents are hidden outright.

 * This is not an optimisation looking for a problem. A walker sees about 23 m
 * of ground; a quad at 80 m sees the entire town, and the town is drawn as
 * thousands of separate small meshes because nothing that draws it ever
 * expected them all to be in one frustum. Frustum culling alone cannot help
 * with a view that genuinely contains everything. So the far half of the town
 * is dropped past this radius, measured from the camera, on a grid of cells
 * whose contents are grouped at build time. Numbers in PROGRESS.md.
 *
 * ROUND 29 CHANGED WHAT THIS LEVER IS WORTH, so the value moved with it. When
 * almost everything cast a shadow, cutting the radius from 100 to 70 bought
 * 174 draw calls at street and the conclusion was that the radius was a weak
 * lever. With the casters restricted it buys 402 at the worst view, 1638 to
 * 1236, because the work it removes is no longer being paid for a second time
 * in a shadow pass that the radius cannot reach.

 * fewer instanced chunks, 1200 at 40 m against 458 at 80 m, and every one of

 * radius the worst view is 3.43 M triangles against 2.51 M at 40 m, because a

/*
 * How coarsely the static merge groups geometry, and why it is NOT CULL_CELL.
 *
 * These were one constant, and making them one was a mistake that hid the
 * town's real cost for two rounds. Sweeping it moved three things at once,
 * the merge, the instanced chunking and the cull grid, so every value looked
 * like a bad trade and the conclusion was that there was nothing to win.
 *
 * Measured separately they want opposite things, because the town's draw
 * calls and the town's triangles live in different objects:
 *
 *   static, merged     7229 meshes    1,338,381 triangles
 *   instanced foliage  1565 meshes    4,540,348 triangles
 *
 * The static half is almost all draw call and almost no triangle. At the
 * street viewpoint 1,229,557 of those 1,338,381 triangles were being drawn
 * anyway, so culling the static half at 40 m was buying 8 percent of its
 * triangles at a cost of thousands of separate objects, in a frame of 5981
 * draw calls. A draw call is what the town is actually short of. So the merge
 * is given the whole town, geometry that shares a material becomes one mesh
 * wherever it stands, and the 8 percent is paid gladly.
 *
 * The instanced half is the mirror image: 4.5 M triangles in objects that are
 * already one draw call each, where a bounding sphere spanning a grove means
 * every tree in it is submitted whether or not one is in frame. That half
 * keeps CULL_CELL, and so does the cull grid.
 *
 * buildCullGrid needs no change to cope: it already routes anything whose
 * bounding sphere exceeds a cell into `always`, so a town wide merge is
 * frustum culled and never distance culled, which is the correct handling and
 * not a special case written for this.
 */
/*
 * ROUND 32 PUT THIS BACK TO Infinity, and the reason is a measurement rather
 * than a preference. Splitting the static merge spatially makes it distance
 * cullable, which costs draw calls and buys triangles, monotonically. Swept
 * twice, before and after the texture atlas, worst of four viewpoints at a
 * 70 m radius:
 *
 *   Infinity   1372 calls   2,426,187 triangles
 *   120        1597 calls   2,367,100

 *   60         1807 calls   2,069,086
 *
 * 225 draw calls for 59,000 triangles at 120. Draw calls are the binding
 * budget by a wide margin, 3.5x over against 2.0x, so the trade is negative
 * until that stops being true. It is a real lever and it is pointing the wrong

 *
 * Platforms are the other half of the model and they are what makes a city
 * worth flying: a roof, the supermarket roof car park and the overbridge deck

 * gated on being within a step of where the query is made from, which is
 * exactly the behaviour a quad wants: above a deck you land on it, below it
 * you fly under it. What `heightAt` cannot express is that a deck is also
 * solid from underneath, so every platform raised more than PLATFORM_SOLID_MIN

 * 2 cm below the deck so that a craft descending onto it meets the landing
 * judgement first and the slab only ever catches something arriving from

 * Trimming the town's keep-out volumes down to the things they stand for.
 *
 * THE TOWN'S RECTANGLES ARE NOT THE TOWN'S SURFACES. They were authored for a
 * walker, and a walker's collider is a keep-out volume with the walker's own
 * body allowed for: `plotCollide` pads every building plot by 0.1 m a side,
 * `district.js` pads one frontage by 1.0 m and one flank by 1.8 m, a 1.3 by
 * 0.7 m shed gets a 1.4 by 1.4 m box, and a tree trunk gets 1.15 times its
 * own radius. None of that is visible to a person on foot, who cannot put
 * their shoulder in the 10 cm anyway. All of it is visible to a quad, which
 * is flown at the gaps on purpose and reads a barrier standing off the wall
 * it belongs to as an invisible wall. The owner's report was exactly that:
 * "the collisions need to HUG the graphics, i want to hit gaps but in many
 * places they are actually invisible walls".
 *
 * AND THE RECTANGLE IS THE WRONG SHAPE, NOT ONLY THE WRONG SIZE. A walker
 * cannot go under a torii's lintel, through the gap between two sheds or
 * beneath a verandah, so the town draws one rectangle around each of those
 * and is right to. A quad can do all three, and does it on purpose. So the
 * fit below does not only shrink a rectangle, it CUTS it wherever the drawing
 * inside it leaves a hole big enough to fly.
 *
 * The algorithm is the slab fit, and it is documented where it is written,
 * further down this file. What is here is the vocabulary it works in.
 *
 * It runs before src/maps/city/bake.js for the same reason references.js
 * does: after the merge a wall is anonymous floats in a shared buffer.

/*
 * THE SLAB FIT, which is what actually makes the solid world hug the drawn
 * one, and what replaced the ownership vote above.
 *
 * WHAT THE OWNERSHIP VOTE COULD NOT DO, MEASURED. Scanned by ./scan.js
 * against the town as it stood, 3261 of the 5885 authored rectangles had NO
 * geometry that passed the two thirds ownership test, so the fit could say
 * nothing about them and they kept every centimetre of their authored
 * standoff. Another 2190 had owned geometry and were still declined by the
 * coverage rule. The result was 55,083 m3 of solid volume with nothing drawn
 * under it, 1940 boxes reaching over a metre past the drawing, 468 over five
 * metres, and 935 standing on air outright. That is the invisible wall, and
 * it is most of the town.
 *
 * THE IDEA. A rectangle is cut into SLABS across its long axis, each slab a
 * strip spanning the whole of its short axis, and every drawn mesh that
 * touches a slab writes its own extent into it. A slab then knows four
 * things about the drawing standing in it: how high it reaches, how low it
 * starts, and how far across the strip it spreads. Runs of adjacent slabs
 * become one box each, and a box is the UNION of the mesh boxes assigned to
 * it, clipped to the rectangle the town authored.
 *
 * WHY THIS CANNOT OPEN A HOLE, WHICH THE OWNERSHIP VERSION COULD. Every
 * drawn mesh inside the rectangle is assigned to some slab, and every
 * occupied slab is inside some run, and every run box contains the union of
 * its slabs' mesh boxes. So the solid volume always contains the drawn
 * geometry: it is a hull, not a sample. The 78.9 m lineside railing that an
 * earlier version collapsed to a single 0.18 m post cannot collapse here,
 * because each baluster's own box is inside the run that covers it. That is
 * why the coverage rule and the two metre cap are both gone: they existed to
 * guard a fit that could lose geometry, and this one cannot.
 *
 * WHY A SLAB IS A STRIP AND NOT A COLUMN. A strip crosses the whole
 * rectangle, so it meets both of a building's side walls whatever is or is
 * not drawn between them. A column in the middle of a house would see only
 * the roof, whose underside is the eaves, and lifting the box to the eaves
 * would hollow the building out. The strip makes enclosure along the short
 * axis free, and the short axis is split by a second pass over each run, at
 * which point the run is small enough that the same argument holds again.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE. A rectangle with nothing drawn in it at
 * all keeps its authored box exactly. It is usually load bearing: the lake
 * edge, the map boundary, a parked level crossing boom.

 * anything that varies along BOTH. A hip roof's first cut sees the ridge from
 * every x and its second sees the hip end from every z, so neither finds a
 * step to break a run on and what comes back is one box at the ridge over a
 * roof that falls away from it in four directions. A flat roof with a parapet

 * THE PITCHED ROOFS, as ground.
 *
 * A flat roof here was always a platform a quad lands on. A pitched one was
 * the collider fit's staircase: boxes a metre across hugging the tiles, each
 * step a vertical face, so a plane skidding up a roof met a wall every metre
 * and a quad set down on one stood on a step. The owner asked for every roof
 * to be ground a plane can land on, skid along and bounce off, so each roof
 * the town draws becomes what alps/roofs.js makes of a village's: its drawn
 * upper faces, planes over their own triangles, offered by height() within
 * a step of fromY as a platform is, and the fit's boxes under and in it
 * letting the sweep through while that roof is the craft's ground. Where
 * the fit's lift stopped short of a tall gable (ROOF_LIFT_MAX), the gable
 * is closed as a village gable is, by the thin wall under it
 * (alps/roofs.js gableSolids), piece by piece where no box of the fit
 * already stands.
 *
 * A roof is a mesh drawn in one of the town's roof coverings, found by its
 * colour: the four house roofs, the tiled roofs of the old houses, the
 * onsen and the shrine, the school's and the gym's. Its faces are its
 * triangles that face up and stand over the ground; the fit's boxes are its
 * own when their middle is under it and their top no higher than it there.
 * The staircase stays as it is; only while the roof is ground does it let
 * a craft through, as a village roof's walls do. Runs on the collider
 * set before build(), so the gables it adds are in the broadphase. What is not in a roof colour (a
 * carport's clear sheet, a train's roof) is not a roof here.
