/*
 * cavity.js: air the town DRAWS and the town does not let you fly through.
 *
 * WHY A THIRD SCAN. ./scan.js measures solid volume ABOVE the drawn roof, and
 * scripts/gap-scan.js probes the inside of a compact collider. Between them
 * they find a bus shelter walled across its mouth and a barrier standing off
 * its wall. Neither can see the failure the owner reported on 2026-09-17,
 * which is the one a pilot meets most often: "the bridges over the canal seem
 * like you can fly under them but you can't". The undercroft of a bridge is
 * below the drawn deck, not above it, so the phantom scan calls the deck
 * honest; and the thing filling it was not a collider at all, so the gap scan
 * could not see it either. It was the CONTACT SURFACE. src/main.js asks
 * `view.height(x, z, y - SURFACE_BIAS)` every step and treats a craft below
 * the answer as buried, and the canal's `ctx.cut` set that surface to the bank
 * level right across a channel drawn 1.75 m deep. There was no box in the
 * water. There was a floor over it.
 *
 * SO THIS ONE ASKS THE PILOT'S QUESTION DIRECTLY. Voxelise the town. For each
 * cell ask two things that have nothing to do with each other:
 *
 *   DRAWN   is there anything drawn within TOL of this cell. The terrain
 *           answers for itself, from its own triangles, because a hillside's
 *           bounding box says nothing about one point on it.
 *   SOLID   would the craft be stopped here. That is the union of every
 *           collider box AND the contact floor, evaluated the way the frame
 *           loop evaluates it, `fromY` and all.
 *
 * A cell that is DRAWN-open and SOLID is a wall a pilot cannot see. Flood fill
 * the free air from the sky, then flood the blocked cells that TOUCH that air.
 * What comes out is one finding per opening, with its own box and its own
 * volume, and the reason it is solid: a collider index, or the floor.
 *
 * THE FLOOD IS THE WHOLE POINT, AND IT IS WHAT KEEPS A HOUSE OUT OF THE LIST.
 * The inside of a building is also DRAWN-open and SOLID: the walls are drawn,
 * the room between them is not, and the collider fills it. That is correct and
 * must not be reported. It is not reported because the room does not touch
 * free air: every path out of it crosses a drawn wall. An undercroft does
 * touch free air, at both ends, which is exactly why a pilot aims at it.
 *
 * IT IS OFF UNLESS ASKED FOR, like ./scan.js, and for the same reason: it
 * rasterises tens of millions of cells and no player's load should pay for a
 * diagnostic. globalThis.__CITY_CAVITY gates it and scripts/cavity-scan.js
 * sets the flag.

/*
 * EVERYTHING THE TOWN DRAWS, IN ONE TRAVERSAL, AND IN THREE WAYS.
 *
 * WHY NOT ./drawn.js, WHICH ALREADY DOES THIS. Because its subdivision is
 * capped, on purpose, and the cap is fatal here. It refuses to cut a mesh
 * into cells bigger than 2.5 m, so the canal's `canalChannel` -- two
 * revetment walls and a bed baked into one 207 m mesh -- keeps its bounding
 * box, and that box is the CHANNEL: 207 by 1.75 by 5 m of "drawn" over water
 * a quad flies along. Reading it, the scan called the whole reach solid on
 * purpose and found nothing. The fit can live with that because it only ever
 * grows a rectangle it was already given; a scan that asks "is anything drawn
 * here" cannot.
 *
 * So each mesh takes one of three routes.
 *
 *   TERRAIN, which is any triangle over TERRAIN_TRI_AREA in plan inside a
 *   mesh over TERRAIN_FOOTPRINT. It goes into a height field, because a
 *   hillside's box says nothing about one point on it, and everything under
 *   that height is ground. The cell centre has to be inside the triangle, not
 *   just inside its box: landform.js drops every triangle with a corner in
 *   the canal's excavation, so the ground genuinely stops at the channel, and
 *   a box test would bleed the bank's last triangle two metres out over the
 *   water and hide the very thing this scan is for.
 *
 *   INSTANCED, which is a prop, by one box per instance. Rasterising a
 *   grove's triangles per instance is three hundred thousand copies of a
 *   trunk and it answers nothing a box does not.
 *
 *   EVERYTHING ELSE, triangle by triangle, evaluating the triangle's own
 *   PLANE over each cell it covers. A triangle is planar by definition, so
 *   this is exact for a wall, a slab, a roof slope and a bridge soffit alike,
 *   and it is what makes a baked 207 m mesh describe its own two walls
 *   instead of the space between them.
