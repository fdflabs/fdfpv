/*
 * works.js: 旧 ひばり製作所, the disused works on the works road.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. A 町工場: the small machine shop that stands at the edge of
 * every Japanese suburb, on the land the houses ran out at. Sawtooth roof,
 * corrugated cladding, a two storey office with the glass gone, a brick
 * stack, a water tower, and a block wall along the road with the gate
 * chained. It stopped twenty years ago, the town grew round it, and nobody
 * has decided what to do with the site. The demolition notice on the fence
 * says the same.
 *
 * WHY THIS AND NOT THE STANDALONE BANDO REBUILT. Industrial bando, which was
 * its own freestyle map until 2026-08-30 and is in the history at 974f4ce,
 * was a 58 m stack and a 42 m preheater on a hundred metre site, painted for
 * a sunset ochre sky it brought with it. Dropped into this town it would be
 * four times the height of anything here, out of the shadow camera, and out
 * of the palette: its own `palette.js` said in as many words that its colours
 * existed to fight this town's. So what crosses over is the VOCABULARY, not
 * the model. Rust,
 * profiled sheet, punched openings, a landable roof, a yard with weeds
 * through the concrete, and one tall thing to fly round. Everything is drawn
 * out of the city's own PAL and stands at suburban height: the stack is
 * 15.5 m against the school's 10.5 and the utility poles' 9.2, so it is the
 * tallest built thing at this end of the town and it is still a thing a
 * town could contain.
 *
 * THE FLIGHT LINES, and they are the reason for every dimension below.
 * Industrial bando learned this the hard way and wrote it down three times:
 * a shaft with a hole in the floor is a DIVE, and the owner's report was
 * "too many chimney dives, not fun". The fix is always to punch the far face
 * as well, so the shape becomes a LINE. So:
 *
 *   1. THROUGH THE SHED, north to south. A 4.4 m sliding door in the south
 *      gable and a 4.4 m hole where the cladding has gone off the north
 *      gable, both from the floor to 4.65 m. Eighteen metres of shed, one
 *      line, in one end and out the other.
 *   2. THROUGH THE SHED, east to west, CROSSING the first. Three sheets are
 *      off the west wall at z 99.0 to 102.2 and three off the east wall at
 *      exactly the same z. Twenty metres, at right angles to line 1, and
 *      they cross in the middle at floor level.
 *   3. IN THROUGH THE CLERESTORY. The middle tooth's glazing is out over
 *      3.2 m. That is an entry at 6.4 to 8.2 m which lands you inside the
 *      roof space and lets you drop and leave by either of the first two.
 *   4. THE ROOF HOLE, which is the one dive, and it is a dive with a run
 *      out: 3.2 by 2.0 m through the third tooth, straight down into a shed
 *      that has two ways out at floor level.
 *   5. THROUGH THE OFFICE, three times. Every opening on the road face has
 *      one at the same x on the yard face, on both floors: three bays of
 *      1.6 m with 1.0 m piers. The first floor set at 4.70 to 6.30 m is
 *      three 5.6 m tunnels with a 0.5 m sill to clear on the way in, and the
 *      ground floor's middle bay is a doorway that goes straight through.
 *   6. UNDER THE STAIR LANDING, under the flue duct between the boiler
 *      house and the stack, under the water tower, and through the hole
 *      where the block wall has fallen down. Four gates at head height that
 *      cost no geometry, because each of them is a thing that had to be
 *      there anyway.
 *
 * THE GAP RULE, taken from Industrial bando's kit and worth restating: a
 * leftover between two solids is either 0, a shared face, or at least 1.4 m.
 * Anything in between is a slot a five inch aims at and cannot fit through.
 * Every clearance in the table below was checked against it.
