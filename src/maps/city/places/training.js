/*
 * training.js: ひばり台ドローン練習場, the practice field on the paddy land
 * north of the works and the pool.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. Five things a freestyle pilot has to learn before anything
 * else is fun, each with the clear air it actually needs and its name painted
 * on the ground under it. Nothing here is scored, nothing is gated and
 * nothing is timed: it is a field with the right shapes in it, which is what
 * a real practice field is.
 *
 * WHY THE ELEMENTS ARE THE SHAPES THEY ARE, and this is the whole design.
 *
 *   ORBIT wants ONE tall thing and NOTHING NEAR IT. A yaw spin round a mast
 *   is a fixed radius held while the stick hand does two things at once, and
 *   the two ways to make it unlearnable are to put something inside the
 *   circle and to give the pilot no way to see what radius they are flying.
 *   So the mast is 34 m, its section is a constant 3.0 m so the radius means
 *   the same at every height, the nearest solid in any direction is 26 m, and
 *   the ground under it carries three painted rings at 6, 10 and 14 m. A
 *   pilot can SEE the circle they are flying. Two decks, at 12 and 24 m, are
 *   both landing places and the reference a hurricane is flown between.
 *
 *   A POWER LOOP is one manoeuvre with two halves and the second half is the
 *   one nobody practises: through the gap, up and over, and BACK THROUGH. So
 *   there are two arches rather than one, 16 m apart on the same axis, and
 *   the second one is the reason the first is worth having. 7.0 m of opening
 *   and 5.6 m to the soffit is wide enough to be flown at speed and tight
 *   enough that a sloppy exit is visible.
 *
 *   A WALL TAP is not about the wall, it is about the RUN AT IT. The wall is
 *   12 m of concrete with 30 m of open paddy in front of it, a target at
 *   3.2 m, which is tap height for a five inch, and nothing at all behind it
 *   to catch a bounce.
 *
 *   A SPLIT-S is a height exercise before it is a stick exercise: you have to
 *   know how high you were when you rolled. So the entry is a bar at 12 m and
 *   the exit is a gate at 1.6 m directly under it, and both uprights carry
 *   painted metre marks so the number is on the object rather than in the
 *   HUD. Fly east over the bar, half roll, half loop, come back west through
 *   the gate.
 *
 *   FREE PRACTICE wants nothing in it. The far end of the field is 48 by 14 m
 *   of dry ground with the paddy grid round it and the sky over it.
 *
 * THE PADDIES ARE THE FABRIC, and they are also the reason the field is
 * legible from the air. A 田んぼ grid is a lattice of raised earth bunds
 * holding flat water, and from thirty metres up that lattice is what tells a
 * pilot where everything is. So the whole site is one 16 by 14 m grid: every
 * cell is either flooded paddy or a gravel pad with an element on it, three
 * of the grid lines are widened into the 農道 that gets you round, and there
 * is no other layout logic anywhere in this file.
 *
 * THE WATER IS ABOVE THE GROUND, which is not how a paddy works and is the
 * only way it can be drawn here. `street.js` lays one terrain grid over the
 * valley and anything below it is invisible unless the mesh is cut, which the
 * empty pool pays for and a forty cell paddy grid should not. A real paddy is
 * a diked tray anyway: bunds 0.30 m up, water 0.12 m up, which from the air
 * is exactly the bright rectangle inside a low earth frame that it should be.
 *
 * WHERE. x -4 to 124, z 118 to 188, measured off the built town: the survey
 * in `.loop/evidence/places-lines.js`'s sibling probe put the last collider
 * in the world at z 116 and the ground exactly flat at 0.45 from there to
 * z 190 across the full width. The hills' keep-out ends at z 114 and no
 * summit reaches this far, so `hillAt` is zero over every square metre of it.

 * the same shape as a skipping rope and is where the trick gets its name. So
 * the rail is 30 m, which is four or five hops at freestyle speed, and the
 * pad is two cells so there is landing room on both sides of it rather than
 * water. Everything else in this field is a thing you fly THROUGH or AROUND
 * and it is placed to give the approach clear air; this one is placed to give
 * the run ALONG it clear air, which is why it sits on the south edge with the
 * open apron in front and nothing behind it until the loop's arches.
 *
 * WHY 2.60 m TO THE UNDERSIDE. Three tricks are flown here and they want
 * opposite things. A Jump Rope goes over, so the rail wants to be low enough
 * to pop rather than climb. A Side Loop and a Cinnamon Roll pass UNDER it, so
 * there has to be daylight beneath: `BAR_CLEAR_MIN` in src/game/obstacles.js
 * is 1.5 m and a five inch is 0.25 m across, so 2.60 m to the underside is
 * ten airframes of gap, which is flyable at speed without being a hole you
 * have to aim at. The rail itself is 0.22 m square, the same section as the
 * Split-S bar, which is the thinnest thing in this field that still reads as
 * solid from twenty metres.
 *
 * The uprights stand OUTSIDE the run, one at each end and none in the middle,
 * because a leg halfway along would be the one thing a pilot hopping down the
 * rail cannot see coming.

 * 20 m south, so the drawn ground is x -160..160 and z -180..140 and nothing
 * else. Everything the town has ever built is inside that. This field is the
 * first thing that is not: measured from the air at the practice box's north
 * edge, the ground simply STOPPED at the last bund and there was sky under
 * the horizon for the rest of the frame.
 *
 * The sphere is not the answer either. `planet.js` says that out past the

 * onto it. This map deliberately takes the flat authoring, so the sphere is
 * still drawn but it curves away underneath: at z = 188 flat it is 98 m
 * below, which is past the fog and reads as nothing at all.
 *
 * So the field brings its own. One flat quad in the terrain's own material,
 * 35 mm UNDER it so the overlap is hidden by the grid rather than z-fighting
 * with it, big enough that its own edge is outside the fog from anywhere a
 * pilot can stand in the field: High's fog closes at 65 m, the field's far
 * corner is (128, 188), so the nearest apron edge is 72 m further out than
