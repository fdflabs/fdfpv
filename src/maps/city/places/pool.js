/*
 * pool.js: ひばり台市民プール, the municipal pool on the works road.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The 市民プール every Japanese town of this size has, on the
 * last piece of flat land before the fields: a 25 m outdoor lido, an indoor
 * hall that runs all year, a changing block with a flat roof and a water tank
 * on it, a filter house, a chain link fence and a gate with the hours on it.
 *
 * THE OUTDOOR POOL IS DRAINED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
 *
 * It is April. The notice by the ticket window says the outdoor pool opens on
 * the first of July, and until then it is an empty tiled bowl with last
 * autumn's leaves in the deep end and this spring's blossom drifting into it.
 * That is true of every municipal pool in the country for nine months of the
 * year, it is the reason a pool is the second thing after a bando that people
 * fly, and it is the only way this place gives a pilot something to CARVE:
 * twenty five metres of tiled floor, a shallow end, a step down, a deep end,
 * and vertical walls all the way round to ride. Municipal baths, the standalone
 * map this one was a suburb sized answer to and which is in the history at
 * 974f4ce, drained its 50 m hall for exactly the same reason and said so:
 * there was no water mesh anywhere in that folder, only the white band a
 * drained pool leaves on the tile.
 *
 * THE INDOOR POOL HAS WATER IN IT, and having one of each is the point. The
 * hall is open all year, so it is 25 m of water under a flat roof with a door
 * at each end, and a pilot who wants the surface to be solid and the light to
 * come off it has it, thirty metres from a bowl that is dry.
 *
 * HOW THE BOWL IS SOLID, and it is the one thing here that is not a box.
 * `world.heightAt` answers with the ground, and the ground over an empty pool
 * is not the ground: without help a quad hovering over the deep end reads
 * itself as sitting on a surface 2.55 m above the tile it can see. The town
 * already has the mechanism, because the canal needed it: `ctx.cut` pulls the
 * ground DOWN over a rectangle, and `heightAt` takes the minimum over the
 * cuts before it takes the maximum over the platforms. Two cuts, one per
 * floor level, and the bowl is a bowl to the height query as well as to the
 * eye.
 *
 * THE FLIGHT LINES.
 *
 *   1. THE BOWL. In over the coping at the shallow end, down the 0.9 m
 *      shelf, over the step, along the 2.55 m deep end and out over the far
 *      wall. Twenty five metres of transition with a wall on both sides.
 *   2. THROUGH THE HALL, west to east. A 4.6 m door in each gable, floor to
 *      4.4 m, twenty eight metres apart, with 25 m of water and three lane
 *      ropes under you.
 *   3. THROUGH THE HALL, the other way and higher. The clerestory band is a
 *      real 1.5 m opening on BOTH long faces at 5.6 to 7.1 m, so the hall
 *      crosses at high level as well as at low. Same lesson Industrial bando
 *      wrote down three times: punch the far face or the shape is a dive.
 *   4. THE ENTRANCE CORRIDOR. The changing block is twelve metres deep and
 *      the way through it is a 2.2 m corridor from the forecourt to the pool
 *      deck. In off the road, through the building, out onto the deck.
 *   5. UNDER THE GALLERY inside the hall, under the 監視台's seat, under the
 *      springboard, and over the roof of the changing block, which is
 *      landable and is the best place on the site to sit and look at the
 *      town.
