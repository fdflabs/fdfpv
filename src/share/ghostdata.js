/*
 * ghostdata.js: the ghost lap wire format, and nothing else.
 *
 * A ghost is one recorded lap: the craft's pose sampled onto a fixed time
 * grid, plus the gate split times, so another run can chase it and read a
 * gap at every gate. The pose is scene world space, the Three.js frame
 * (y up, metres) that src/game/race.js scores in, sampled downstream of
 * the one physics-to-render conversion in src/render/frame.js. That space
 * is deterministic per course, so a ghost recorded in one browser replays
 * in any other on the same course, and no consumer of this file ever
 * converts a coordinate.
 *
 * Time inside a ghost is milliseconds from its own lap start, which is the
 * timing gate crossing. Sample i sits at i * 1000 / rateHz ms. The player's
 * running lap uses the same zero, so chasing is one subtraction.
 *
 * The format is binary and versioned, deliberately shaped like the .rec
 * stick format in tests/lib/recfile.js: DataView only, little-endian,
 * environment neutral, so the same module encodes in the browser, decodes
 * in the browser, and is exercised by a Node selftest. The board stores the
 * base64 of these bytes beside the lap time; its validate.js mirrors the
 * header check, the same way it mirrors NAME_RE from pilot.js.
 *
 * Layout, little-endian:
 *
 *   bytes 0..7  magic "FPVGHST1"
 *   u32         version = 1
 *   u32         sample rate, Hz
 *   u32         sample count
 *   u32         lap duration, ms
 *   u32         split count, one per gate crossing in the lap, in order,
 *               each u32 ms from lap start; the last one is the finish
 *   u32         reserved, zero
 *   then splitCount x u32
 *   then per sample, 20 bytes:
 *     f32 x 3   position x y z, scene world metres
 *     i16 x 4   attitude quaternion x y z w, each component / 32767
 *
 * The quaternion is quantised because sixteen bits per component is far
 * below what an eye can see on a translucent craft, and it is what keeps a
 * minute of lap under 40 KB. Consecutive samples are hemisphere aligned at
 * encode time (q and -q are the same rotation), so a decoder can nlerp
 * neighbours without checking the sign.
