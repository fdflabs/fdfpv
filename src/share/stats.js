/*
 * stats.js: what this browser tells the board about a session, and what it
 * refuses to tell it.
 *
 * WHAT THE BOARD'S STATISTICS PAGE IS, FROM THIS END. It counts sessions,
 * laps, countries and returning pilots. Everything it holds is a COUNTER: a
 * total per UTC day, and a total per day per dimension. There is no row at
 * the far end that describes one browser, and this file is the reason there
 * cannot be, because it is the only thing that sends anything.
 *
 * THREE EVENTS AND NOTHING ELSE.
 *
 *   visit    once per browser per UTC day, across the simulator, the
 *            builder and the board. Carries which page, and a BOOLEAN
 *            saying whether this browser has been here before.
 *   session  once per page load, the first time the quad leaves the stand.
 *            Carries the aircraft, the map and how the pilot is flying.
 *   flush    once a minute while a session is open, and again the moment
 *            the page goes away. Carries laps, flight seconds and crashes
 *            since the last one, and a random per tab handle.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT IN ANY OF THEM, and has nowhere to go if somebody adds it
 * later: an address, a user agent, a screen size, a referrer, a pilot name,
 * a track id, a tune, a lap time, or a timestamp of any kind. The board
 * stamps its own UTC day and never reads a clock from here, because a
 * browser's clock is wrong often enough to put laps in tomorrow.
 *
 * THE TAB HANDLE IS THE ONE UNIQUE STRING, and it is deliberately useless.
 * It is made fresh at page load, it answers exactly one question ("how many
 * are flying right now"), the board holds it in memory for three minutes,
 * and no table at either end ever sees it. Reloading makes a new one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BROWSER REMEMBERS, in one key, and none of it is ever sent: the
 * day it was first counted, the last day it was counted, a sponsor slug for
 * thirty days, and whether the pilot has switched counting off. What is sent
 * is the ANSWER those produce.
 *
 * THIS MIRRORS public/stats.js IN THE BOARD'S REPOSITORY, the same
 * arrangement NAME_RE has: two repositories, so it cannot be imported.
 * The storage key is shared on purpose, because under one domain the three
 * pages share one origin and therefore one local storage, so a pilot who
 * switches counting off on the board has switched it off here. Change both
 * copies, or the promise stops being kept in one of them.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE PHYSICS PATH. The counters are read off race
 * state the render loop already computed, the handle comes from
 * crypto.randomUUID, and every send is a beacon that cannot block a frame.
 * A board that is down, asleep or blocked costs this file nothing, because
 * it never reads a reply.
