/*
 * windows.js: how many tabs this product is allowed to leave open.
 *
 * One simulator, one board. Every link between the three sites carried
 * target="_blank" or window.open(..., '_blank'), so a session spent moving
 * between them ended with a row of tabs, several of them running a physics
 * loop and a WebGL context nobody was looking at. Flying three courses off
 * the board left three simulators.
 *
 * The fix is the oldest one the platform has: a named browsing context.
 * Opening a URL under a name navigates the tab already carrying that name
 * instead of making another, and focuses it. So there are two names, here,
 * written down once:
 *
 *   fdfpv-sim     the simulator page and the track builder, which are one
 *                  tab because the simulator navigates to the builder in
 *                  place and the builder navigates back
 *   fdfpv-board   the leaderboard
 *
 * Two rules come out of that and both are easy to break by accident.
 *
 * `rel="noopener"` cannot ride along. The HTML spec resolves a noopener
 * link by setting the target name to "_blank" before it looks anything up,
 * so a named link that also asks for noopener silently opens a new tab
 * every time, which is the bug this file exists to fix. Dropping it hands
 * the opened page a cross origin `window.opener`, which can do three things
 * to us: postMessage, close, and set our location. Both ends of every link
 * here are our own sites, so that is a trade worth making. Do not extend
 * a named target to a link that leaves the product.
 *
 * A tab has to claim its name to be found. A name set by whoever opened
 * the tab is not enough: the simulator opened from a bookmark has no name,
 * so the board's Fly this track would not find it and would open a second
 * one. Every page that is one of the two tabs calls claimWindowName as
 * early as it can. window.name survives same origin navigation, so the
 * simulator keeps the claim when it goes to the builder.
 *
 * What this does not do is reach across browsing context groups. A board
 * and a simulator the player opened separately, neither from the other,
 * cannot see each other's names, and the first link between them makes one
 * more tab. From then on the pair is joined and stays a pair.
 *
 * A modifier click still opens a new tab, because the browser overrides the
 * target when the player asks for that. That is deliberate: "open in a new
 * tab" is the player's to say.
