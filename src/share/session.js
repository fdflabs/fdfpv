 * A pilot flies a five inch on a sixty metre field or a 65 mm whoop in a
 * RaceGOW room, and that choice governs everything downstream of it: which
 * track the shell loads behind the title, which canvas the builder opens,
 * which tracks the board offers. The alternative, threading a class argument
 * through the nine modules that read a seat, was tried on paper and it is
 * nine places for the answer to be different.
 *
 * The seated AIRCRAFT is the copy of record, because that is the thing a
 * pilot chooses; the class is read off it. It lives in the shell's settings
 * because the shell owns settings, and this module reads that key rather
 * than importing the shell, which would be a cycle and would pull the whole
 * user interface into the builder.
