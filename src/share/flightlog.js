/*
 * flightlog.js: record a flight and write it out as a blackbox log.
 *
 * WHY THE SIMULATOR RECORDS. scripts/replay-log.js can take a real quad's
 * blackbox log, fly its sticks through this build and report what the plant
 * got wrong. That is the instrument. This is the other half of it: the
 * simulator writing its OWN flight in the same format, for two jobs that
 * both matter.
 *
 *   Diagnosis. "It feels different" is not something a maintainer can act
 *   on, and it cost this project a whole archaeology session once already.
 *   A log of the flight that felt wrong is: rates, sticks, pack voltage and
 *   rotor speeds against time, which either shows the anomaly or rules the
 *   plant out.
 *
 *   Comparison. A sim log and a real log in the same format go through the
 *   same parser and the same report, so "here is my quad, here is the sim,
 *   flying the same line" is a diff rather than an argument.
 *
 * THE FORMAT is blackbox_decode's CSV, not Betaflight's packed binary. The
 * binary is a format this project does not own and reimplementing its
 * writer would be a second decoder to keep in sync for no gain: every tool
 * that reads blackbox reads the decoded CSV too, and tests/lib/blackbox.js
 * parses exactly this.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT IN A ROW. Time, sticks, gyro and pack voltage are the
 * real thing, straight off the state block. The motor columns carry ROTOR
 * SPEED normalised against a nominal full throttle, NOT the duty a real ESC
 * logs, because duty never crosses the ABI: the module reports RPM. That is
 * written down here rather than left for someone to discover, because a
 * motor column that looks like a duty and is not is exactly the sort of
 * thing that quietly ruins a comparison.
 *
 * RATE. One row per rendered frame, so 60 to 144 Hz rather than a real
 * FC's 1 to 8 kHz. The stick and gyro pair in a row are read at the same
 * instant, so the row is honest; there are simply fewer of them. Enough to
 * see a manoeuvre, not enough to see filter phase.

 *
 * The pitch channel is negated on the way out for the same reason the
 * parser negates it on the way in: bf_glue.c builds rcData[PITCH] as
 * 1500 MINUS the ABI channel, so a log's positive pitch is this ABI's
 * negative pitch. The two negations are one convention, and they are
 * tested against each other by scripts/replay-log.js --selftest.
