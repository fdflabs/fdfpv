/*
 * plan.js: a course, drawn as a plan.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS HERE AND NOT ONLY ON THE BOARD. A course was three different
 * pictures depending on where you met it: a recorded flight clip on the
 * simulator's map screen, a blueprint plan on the public board, a blueprint
 * canvas in the track builder. Two of those agreed and the odd one out was
 * the screen where you CHOOSE which course to fly, so a pilot picked a
 * course without ever seeing its shape. The drawing is cheap and the data
 * is already there, so the simulator draws the same picture the other two do.
 *
 * PORTED, NOT REWRITTEN. The drawing code below is
 * fdfpv-leaderboard/public/plan.js, carried over unchanged, and
 * planFromDocument is that repository's src/validate.js. Both are GPLv3 and
 * both are ours. The pair MUST keep drawing the same picture: if a mark
 * changes shape here, change it there in the same turn, or the same course
 * looks like two courses.
 *
 * The two ends of the pipe differ in one way only. The board holds published
 * courses and ships a plan payload with its list, so it never sees a document.
 * The simulator holds the working canvas as a schema.md document and has to
 * derive the plan from it, which is what planFromDocument is for. Give
 * drawPlan a plan from either source and it cannot tell them apart.

 * THE SIX ABOVE ARE FALLBACKS NOW, AND A PLAN FROM EITHER PRODUCER READS
 * NONE OF THEM.
 *
 * Each one used to be the size EVERY mark of its type was drawn at,
 * whatever the document said, and that was fine for exactly as long as
 * every track was a MultiGP one. On a 5 by 6 m room a gate held at 1.524 m
 * drew a bar 30 percent of the way across the plate, where the 0.711 m gate
 * it stands for is 14 percent of it, and the start line held at 4.5 m ran
 * two thirds of the way across the room. Measured on
 * tracks/json/micro-livingroom-1.json in a board tile: the gate bar was
 * 44.9 px on a 147 px plate and is 20.9 px now.
 *
 * The document has carried the real numbers all along, dims.clearW on a
 * gate and dims.pads with dims.spacing on the start, in exactly the way it
 * carries a barrier's width and a stack's level count, both of which this
 * drawer already reads. The gate opening was simply missed. So the plan
 * payload carries it, the drawer reads it, and these six are what a plan
 * built by something with no dimensions at all falls back to.
 *
 * BOTH PRODUCERS HAVE TO EMIT IT or the pair stops drawing the same
 * picture: planFromDocument in the simulator's src/share/plan.js, and the
 * board's own copy in src/validate.js.
 *
 * DIVE_W IS THE ONE OF THE SIX THAT REAL DOCUMENTS DISAGREE WITH, and it is
 * worth writing down because it means this change is not invisible on full
 * sized tracks. 2.13 is a 7 ft dive gate, which is what MultiGP publishes,
 * but not one dive gate under tracks/ is built at 7 ft: all fourteen of
 * them, across eleven documents, carry a 1.524 m opening like every other
 * aperture on those tracks, and the plan has been drawing each of them 40
 * percent oversize. Reading the document shrinks them to the size they are.
 * Measured: on the board's track sheet, the widest a plan is drawn here,
 * the square goes from 9.35 px to 7.0 px; at every smaller size both the
 * old number and the new one sit on the 3.5 px floor below and nothing
 * moves at all. Every other mark on those eleven tracks, at four card
 * sizes, with and without the scale bar, is drawn by the identical calls
 * with the identical arguments.
 */

/*
 * THE MICRO TWINS: the sizes that are not on a mark to be read.
 *
 * A plan carries its track class, 'full' or 'micro', the same way the
 * object src/game/trackdoc.js builds for the game carries it and for the
 * same reason, that almost everything downstream of a document is a length.
 * Everything below is a length that could not be read off a mark, either
 * because the document does not hold it or because reading it would change
 * what a full sized track has always looked like.

 * flag's pole is 25 mm, because 25 mm on a sixty metre field is nothing.
 * The twin is the same rule at the other end: the indoor marker cone the
 * element library carries is 100 mm tall on a 60 mm base, so this is that
 * base, life size again. Left at 0.18 a cone on a 5 m room draws 360 mm

 * A MICRO PLAN IS DRAWN ON THE TRACK, NOT ON THE ROOM, and this is the

 * fits the track. A RaceGOW track is 1.42 by 2.13 m in the MIDDLE of a
