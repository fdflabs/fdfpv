 * boot.js: the entry point, and the only module that runs before three.js.
 *
 * It exists so the loading screen can report the three.js fetch. A page whose
 * entry module imports three at module scope cannot: the browser fetches the
 * whole static graph before a line of that module runs, so the first thing
 * the player would see is a blank page for however long the CDN takes. This
 * file imports only the loading screen, drives the fetch itself with a
 * streamed reader for byte progress, and then dynamically imports main.js,
 * which does import three statically and is served from cache by then.
 *
 * The three.js URL is read out of the page's own import map rather than
 * written down again here, so there is exactly one place it lives.

   * a moment later would be served from the HTTP cache. Measured, that
   * assumption is not safe: `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')` came
   * back with TWO entries for three.module.js, so the browser made two
   * requests, and whether the second one costs 1.2 MB over the wire depends
   * entirely on the CDN's cache headers and on the harness, which fulfils
   * jsdelivr from a local cache and returns no caching headers at all.
   *
   * Paying up to 1.2 MB of a player's connection to animate a progress bar is
   * the wrong trade, and a bar that is honest about the network is the whole
   * point of this screen. So the stage keeps its NAME and its elapsed time
   * readout, which is what makes a stall legible, and it does not pretend to
   * know how far through it is. The stages that can measure their progress
   * honestly still do: dist/sim.wasm streams its bytes because the shell
   * needs them anyway, and the map graph counts modules off the browser's own
   * resource timing.
