 * The knee in the restitution curve, metres per second.

 * A wall tap should push the quad off a little and let a pilot fly out
 * of it, and it should do that the SAME WAY at every speed. Two shapes
 * have been tried here and both were wrong in the way a pilot notices.
 *
 * 14 m/s of linear falloff was a steel number on a machine made of
 * nylon, carbon plate and a strapped-on lithium brick: a fast hit sprang
 * back. Dropping it to 6 fixed that and broke something worse. The
 * falloff is clamped at the bottom, so the product e * v rose to 0.225
 * m/s at 3 m/s, fell off a cliff to 0.043 by 5.7 m/s where the clamp
 * bites, and then CLIMBED again with speed. A 5 m/s tap came off three
 * times harder than a 6 m/s one. Nothing in the world behaves like that
 * and a pilot cannot learn it.
 *
 * What a structure actually does is store a bounded amount of elastic
 * energy. Below the knee the contact is elastic at the material's own
 * coefficient. Above it the compliant part of the airframe, the skin,
 * the arms, the battery strap, has bottomed out, and everything past
 * that goes into deformation and does not come back. So the SEPARATION
 * SPEED saturates while the impact keeps growing:
 *
 *   e_used = e * min(1, CONTACT_E_KNEE / closing)
 *
 * which is e * closing while slow, and e * CONTACT_E_KNEE for ever
 * after. Monotonic, no cliff, and bounded by the material: a wall caps
 * at 0.26 m/s, PVC at 0.37, bark at 0.20, the train at 0.10, so the
 * materials still differ at speed instead of collapsing together.
 *
 * The low-speed end is untouched. CONTACT_E_FLOOR still holds a gentle
 * touch off the surface: a light tap welding on was the first half of

 * gives one point and the full moment, a belly flat on the face gives
 * four and almost none. (rx, ry, rz) is the vector from the CG to that
