 * speed off harder.
 *
 * THE ONE WORD THIS ANSWERS IS "FLOATY". The board keeps returning it, and
 * the two rounds that answered it moved exactly these numbers by hand: round
 * 17b added the rotor H force because the model "felt floaty and blew out
 * corners", and the mass went up twice off a report asking for more gravity.
 * Of the two, the drag set is the one that moves the feel without moving
 * anything a pilot has learned: hover stays where it is on the stick, the
 * punch and the climb are untouched, and what changes is how far the craft
 * carries with the sticks centred. Measured on the shipped five inch,
 * levelled and coasting from 20 m/s down to 10 m/s: 3.64 s and 102 m at 1.0,
 * 2.93 s and 79 m at 1.5 on the rotor term alone, 2.14 s and 60 m at 1.5 on
 * the whole set.
 *
 * WHAT IT SCALES, and why each one belongs: the per axis quadratic body drag
 * (cda_front, cda_side, cda_plan), which is the airframe's own bluff body
 * drag; k_rotor_drag, the H force, which is the dominant translational
 * damping at the speeds a race is flown at; and k_rotor_axial, the ducted
 * machine's descent brake. All three are the air pushing back on the craft.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT SCALE, deliberately. Not rho, because rho also sets the
 * induced velocity, the vortex ring thresholds and the propwash, so scaling
 * it would move hover, the descent model and the shake, none of which is what
 * "floaty" names. Not k_body_lift, which is a turning force rather than a
 * brake. Not mass, thrust or anything electrical: hover throttle is a number
 * pilots memorise and configs/rates.js quotes in a menu, so this knob leaves
 * it exactly where it is.
 *
 * A MODE, not dynamic state, in the same sense SIM_ARCADE is one: it survives
 * sim_reset and sim_init and the shell owns asserting it. At 1.0 the plant is
 * bit identical to the one before this existed, because x * 1.0 is x for
 * every finite double and no expression here was reassociated to get it. That
 * is measured against the recorded trace hash, not assumed.

/*
 * GRAVITY, set by sim_set_gravity: a scale on the weight this craft carries.
 * 1.0 is 9.80665 and the machine every band was measured against.
 *
 * THIS IS THE OTHER HALF OF "FLOATY", and the pilot named it: asked to try
 * the drag slider, the answer came back "the difference is hardly
 * discernable" and "have it as floaty and sinky". Sinky is not planted.
 * Planted is the HORIZONTAL axis, how far the craft carries with the sticks
 * centred, which is what SIM_AIR moves. Sinky is the VERTICAL one, how fast
 * it comes down and how little it hangs, and no amount of drag buys it:
 * raising drag LOWERS the props level terminal, 22.0 m/s to 18.0 at 1.5, so
 * the drag slider was making the craft hang slightly MORE at the same time
 * as it made it corner better, which is exactly how a knob comes out feeling
 * like nothing.
 *
 * Gravity is the surgical version of that axis. It changes weight and
 * nothing else: inertia is untouched, so the craft rotates identically and
 * every rate figure holds; drag is untouched, so the horizontal coast is
 * unchanged; the motors and the pack are untouched. What moves is hover
 * throttle, sink rate, terminal velocity and how far a punch balloons, which
 * is the whole of what a pilot means by floaty on the vertical axis.
 *
 * Applied to the weight term in plant_step and to the two ground load terms
 * in sim.c, because a heavier craft presses harder on the floor and its
 * friction has to follow or a sinky quad would slide like a light one.
 *

 * sim_init and the shell owns asserting it. Bit identical at 1.0, measured
