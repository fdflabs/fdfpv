/*
 * sim_math.h: deterministic maths for the physics path.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md requires a fixed maths implementation compiled into the WASM
 * module: no JS Math and no libc libm anywhere near the trajectory. These
 * helpers use only IEEE 754 basic operations (add, subtract, multiply,
 * divide) and the wasm f64.sqrt instruction, all of which are specified to
 * bit precision, so the same inputs produce the same bits on every engine
 * and every host.
 *
 * The trig here is intentionally small-angle only. The integrator rotates
 * the attitude quaternion by |omega| * dt per 1 ms step, which stays far
 * inside the polynomial's accurate range. Guard checks enforce that.
