/*
 * plant.c: motors, props, battery and airframe aero for the Stage 1 quad,
 * plus the rigid body update, all at a fixed 1 kHz step.
 *
 * Model, in STAGE1.md's order of contribution to feel:
 *   1. Motor response: DC motor electrical model. Average applied voltage
 *      is duty times pack voltage under load; current through winding
 *      resistance against back EMF; rotor accelerates under motor torque
 *      minus prop drag torque. This yields the first order lag with an
 *      effective time constant inside the 10 to 30 ms band.
 *   2. Thrust kT * omega^2 and prop drag torque kQ * omega^2.
 *   3. Battery sag: pack open circuit voltage minus total current times
 *      internal resistance. Available RPM falls with voltage.
 *   4. Prop drag torque reacts on the frame through the motor stator,
 *      which is where yaw authority and yaw coupling come from.
 *   5. Airframe drag: per axis quadratic in the body frame with separate
 *      plan and frontal areas.
 *
 * Constants not fixed by STAGE1.md are tuned so the closed loop lands
 * inside the verification bands; derivations are in PROGRESS.md. Absolute
 * RPM runs low relative to a real 5 inch quad because hover throttle
 * 0.20 to 0.30 with a linear average voltage ESC model forces the load
 * dominated regime; every check measures ratios or SI kinematics, not
 * absolute RPM, and the trade is recorded in PROGRESS.md.
 *
 * Determinism: fixed operation order, IEEE basic arithmetic and
 * sim_sqrt/sim_sin_small/sim_cos_small only. No libc libm.

/*
 * Propulsion constants rebuilt from the real airframe after a pilot
 * review proved the old pair violated momentum theory (figure of merit
 * 2.01; the physical maximum is 1.0). The derivation chain:
 *
 * kt from the real prop: 1900 kV on 6S under a 5x4.3x3 hovers a 650 g
 * quad near 8750 RPM (916 rad/s), so kt = (mg/4) / w^2 = 1.90e-6.
 *
 * THE FIGURE OF MERIT WAS 0.565 AND THAT IS AN OPTIMISTIC ROTOR. It is now
 * 0.520, and the reason is a board report about the craft gaining altitude
 * on a yaw input. kq is the whole of this airframe's yaw authority, because
 * yaw torque is prop drag reacting through the stator, so an optimistic kq
 * is a quad that has to move more air to turn its nose than it should.
 *
 * The number was not chosen to fix the report, it was checked against an
 * independent measurement and found wrong. Published thrust stand data for
 * a 2207 1900 kV on 6S with a 5x4.3x3 gives about 1.5 kgf and roughly 600 W
 * of shaft power at 26,000 RPM, so shaft torque is P / w = 600 / 2723 =
 * 0.22 N m against 14.7 N of thrust, and the ratio a rotor actually holds
 * is Q / T = 0.0150 m. That ratio is kq / kt and nothing else. At FM 0.565
 * this plant held 0.01414, seven percent light; at 0.520 it holds 0.01536,
 * which is the closest any value in the P5 band gets to the stand.
 *
 * 0.565 was always the top of the 0.4 to 0.6 band, and the top of that band
 * is a clean two blade rotor. A five inch TRIBLADE is not one: the third
 * blade buys thrust in a smaller disc and pays for it in profile drag, and
 * 0.50 to 0.53 is where they measure. PLANT_TORQUE_IND below is the same
 * number and has to move with it, because the induced share of shaft torque
 * IS the figure of merit at hover; that identity is what keeps this pair
 * exactly kq w^2 in the hover and is why checks 5 and 8 do not move.
 *
 * kq from kt through momentum theory with an ENFORCED figure of merit:
 * kq = kt^1.5 / (FM * sqrt(2 rho A)), A = pi 0.0635^2. The two are a
 * physical pair, never two free knobs; sim_bf_debug case 12 recomputes
 * FM from the compiled constants and the P5 gate asserts it in 0.4-0.6.
 *
 * ---- THE ELECTRICAL SET WAS RE-DERIVED AS ONE SYSTEM ----
 *
 * ke, r_motor, r_cell, kq and j_rotor cannot be fixed one at a time and the
 * previous set proved it. It ran the pack at 39 mOhm, which is two and a half
 * times a real 6S 1300, and that resistance was the only thing holding the
 * top end down: drop it on its own and full throttle RPM goes from 26,000 to
 * 34,100, which is a thrust to weight of 15.9. So the sag was doing a job
 * that belonged to the motor. What it cost was measured, and all of it is
 * felt continuously rather than at the margins:
 *
 *   sustained full throttle    187 A pack, 2.99 V a cell
 *   hover                      19.6 percent of stick
 *   duty to RPM                RPM went as duty^0.67, so the bottom of the
 *                              stick was twice as sensitive as the top
 *
 * A 6S pack held at 2.99 V a cell for the length of a straight is not a pack
 * a pilot would fly twice, and hover at a fifth of the stick puts the whole
 * low speed working range inside seven percent of travel.
 *
 * The set below is solved against published thrust stand data for a 2207
 * 1900 kV on 6S with a 5x4.3x3: about 26,000 RPM, 1.5 kgf per motor and 33 A
 * per motor at full throttle, and 3 to 4 A per motor at hover. Two equations,
 * the full throttle and hover equilibria, in the two unknowns ke and r_motor,
 * with r_cell at the 2.5 mOhm a real race pack measures. It lands:
 *
 *   full throttle   2723 rad/s, 32.8 A a motor, 131 A pack, 3.87 V a cell,
 *                   58.7 N of thrust, thrust to weight 9.21
 *   hover           897 rad/s, 3.56 A a motor, duty 0.252
 *   duty to RPM     RPM as duty^0.81, against a real ESC's roughly 0.9
 *
 * WHY ke IS NOT 60/(2 pi 1900). It is 0.006336, which is the constant of a
 * 1507 kV motor, and that is deliberate. Nameplate kV is measured unloaded
 * and real motors saturate: the loaded torque constant of these 2207s is
 * consistently ten to twenty percent better than the plate implies, which is
 * why a thrust stand reads 33 A where 60/(2 pi 1900) predicts 41. Forcing the
 * nameplate value instead would need kq low enough to put the figure of merit
 * at 0.67, above the physical band the P5 gate asserts, so the choice is
 * between an honest ke and a prop that beats momentum theory again. The
 * airframe is still a 1900 kV motor; this is its loaded constant.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL WRONG. There is no winding inductance and no ESC current
 * ceiling, so the instant a punch starts the only thing between duty and
 * current is resistance, and the model briefly draws about 320 A. That figure
 * is silly and it is reported honestly by sim_state. It is NOT a feel defect,
 * because it lasts two or three milliseconds and the rotor's own time
 * constant of 34 ms filters it completely before it reaches thrust. A ceiling
 * cannot be added without breaking check 8, which asks a rotor to reach 63
 * percent of full speed inside 30 ms and therefore demands the current;
 * plant.c has recorded that trade twice now and it needs check 8 re-specified
 * as a small signal measurement, which is a human decision.
 *
 * j_rotor is 8.0e-6 against a real 2207 bell plus 5 inch triblade near 9e-6.
 * 9e-6 reads about 29 ms on check 8 against a 30 ms ceiling, which is not
 * margin worth having; 8.0e-6 is inside the real range and leaves some.

 * SIM_AIRFRAME_WHOOP65: a 65 mm 1S brushless whoop, modelled on the published
 * specification for a 65 mm whoop, which is what a RaceGOW field mostly flies.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER HERE IS DERIVED OR CITED, and the two that the marketing copy
 * gets wrong are corrected rather than copied.
 *
 * MASS. The maker quotes 16.6 g for the stock whoop. That is DRY: the spec table
 * lists no battery and the recommended pack, a 1S 280 mAh pack, is 6.8 g.
 * All up is therefore 23.4 g, and the published "6.3:1 thrust to weight" is
 * the dry figure. Against a flying quad it is 4.7:1 fresh and about 3.8:1 on
 * a tired pack, which is what the thrust budget below actually delivers.
 * A whoop is not an overpowered machine; it is a LIGHT one, and that is a
 * different feeling entirely.
 *
 * INERTIA. Estimated, not published, from point masses: four 1.55 g motors
 * with props at 23 mm on each axis, the frame and its four ducts as a ring
 * at 28 mm, the 6.8 g pack as a 43 x 20 x 6 mm slab at the CG, and 5 g of
 * FC, canopy and camera near the middle. That gives Ixx 5.3e-6 and Iyy
 * 6.2e-6; the values below carry a little more for the parts the estimate
 * does not enumerate. Izz is held near Ixx + Iyy, the perpendicular axis
 * result for a near flat body, times the 0.93 the five inch's own tensor
 * shows. The pitch to roll split is much wider than the five inch's 8
 * percent because the pack is a far larger share of a 23 g machine.
 *
 * WHY THE WHOOP IS CRISP, and it is not the motors. Roll authority is
 * 2 T_max arm / Ixx = 2 x 0.270 x 0.0230 / 6.0e-6 = 2070 rad/s squared,
 * against the five inch's 2 x 14.7 x 0.0778 / 0.0035 = 653. Three times the
 * angular acceleration on a third of the rate. The rotor time constant goes
 * the OTHER way: j R / ke^2 is 26 ms here against the five inch's 36 ms
 * measured at the same operating point, so the motors are comparable and
 * the frame is what changed.
 *
 * kt from the thrust target: 74,750 rpm at full throttle on a fresh cell,
 * 4.7:1 on 23.4 g, is 0.2696 N a rotor at 7828 rad/s, so kt = 4.400e-9.
 * Hover then sits at 3611 rad/s, 34,480 rpm, which is where a 0702 on 1S
 * measures.
 *
 * kq through the SAME momentum theory identity the five inch uses,
 * kq = kt^1.5 / (FM sqrt(2 rho A)), with FM = 0.330. That is far below the
 * five inch's 0.520 and it is not pessimism: a 31 mm three blade at 34,000
 * rpm runs at a chord Reynolds number near 10,700, where the blade section's
 * lift to drag ratio collapses from 60 to about 20 and profile drag eats the
 * disc. Bohorquez measured 0.42 for the best single rotor he built at Re
 * 27,000 to 43,700, and Harris's low Reynolds compilation puts a rotor at
 * Re 10^4 in the 0.30 to 0.40 band. 0.330 is the middle of that band and it
 * is what makes a whoop's yaw authority feel the way it does, because prop
 * drag is the only currency yaw is paid in.
 *
 * THE ELECTRICAL SET IS SOLVED, not typed, exactly as the five inch's was:
 * two equilibria, full throttle and hover, in the two unknowns ke and
 * r_motor, with r_cell pinned at the 55 mOhm a real 1S 280 mAh whoop pack
 * measures. Hover duty was targeted at 0.30, the middle of the 27 to 36
 * percent a modern 1S brushless whoop shows. It lands:
 *
 *   full throttle   7828 rad/s, 4.42 A a motor, 17.7 A pack, 3.23 V
 *   hover           3611 rad/s, 0.94 A a motor, duty 0.300, 4.14 V
 *
 * The sag is the story. 4.2 V open circuit falls to 3.23 V under a punch,
 * a 23 percent collapse, where the five inch's 6S race pack loses 8. That
 * single number is most of why a whoop feels like a whoop: every hard input
 * costs you the top of the throttle, and the tune has to be built around it
 * (see the TPA breakpoint in configs/whoop-*.diff, which the maker drops from
 * 1350 to 1180 for exactly this reason).
 *
 * ke is 2.8515e-4, which is a 33,489 kV motor against a 36,000 kV plate.
 * Same story as the five inch's 1507 against 1900: nameplate kV is measured
 * unloaded and the loaded constant is better. Seven percent here rather than
 * twenty because a 0702 saturates less than a 2207 does.
 *
 * j_rotor is a 0702 bell plus a 1.5 g moulded three blade, estimated at
 * 1.8e-8 with about 35 percent of uncertainty. It is three orders of
 * magnitude under the five inch's 8e-6, which is what people expect, and it
 * does NOT make the motor three orders quicker, because r_motor is 25 times
 * larger and ke is 22 times smaller. That cancellation is the whole
 * correction to the folklore.
 *
 * DRAG. cda_front and cda_side are the solid airframe only, 9.3e-4 m^2 of
 * frontal silhouette at a bluff body Cd of 0.9, because the ducts' own drag
 * is momentum drag and is charged through k_rotor_drag below. cda_plan is
 * the 2.2e-3 m^2 plan silhouette at Cd 1.15, which is what stops a flat fall
 * at about 10 m/s instead of 40.
 *
 * k_rotor_drag is 0.70 against the five inch's 0.43842, and the gap is the
 * duct. The five inch's figure came from a published TOTAL linear drag fit
 * for an open rotor. A shroud captures the whole stream tube instead of a
 * contracted one, so the momentum drag rho A v_i V_perp is paid in full, and
 * the ducted fan literature puts ram drag at 80 to 95 percent of total drag
 * below ten knots. 1.00 is the momentum coefficient with nothing added, and
 * it is what this airframe flew for its first week. It is not what the
 * whoop's duct is. A ducted fan's shroud is a chord deep and captures a
 * whole stream tube; a whoop's duct is a moulded ring a few millimetres
 * tall round a 31 mm prop, open above and below, and the air it turns is
 * closer to an open rotor's than to a fan's. At 1.00 the plant asked 17
 * degrees of pitch for 3.3 m/s and 35 for 8.3, ninety two percent of the
 * drag budget was this one term, and the owner reported the machine hard
 * to fly and wading. 0.70 is the owner's number, flown, sitting between the
 * open rotor's fit and the full shroud, which is where a short ring belongs
 * and where the plant's own review put it. Still, not the body drag, the
 * reason whoops are slow; just less of the reason.

   * then k_duct below multiplied every rotor's thrust by 1.10 on top of it,
   * so the plant made 5.14 : 1 on the bench and 5.31 at the peak of a punch.

   * unit, so the duct is inside it already. kt is now the bare rotor's share
   * of that figure, 4.400e-9 / 1.10, and kt times k_duct is the 4.400e-9 the
   * derivation above arrives at: full throttle is still 7828 rad/s and 4.70
   * to one, and the hover is still 3611 rad/s, both WITH the duct.
   *
   * kq follows kt through the same momentum theory identity, at a figure of
   * merit of 0.310 rather than 0.330, and the reason is the motor rather
   * than the rotor. At 4.7 to one the rotor makes 13 percent less torque at

   * absorb the same voltage headroom with, and at 0.330 the solve put it
   * into winding resistance: r_motor 0.27 ohm, and W7's motor time constant
   * on the ceiling of its band at 45 ms, a slower motor than the one the

   *
   * Measured on the build before this one: chop the throttle and this
   * aircraft settled at 11.7 m/s of descent, which over a room's ceiling
   * height is a fifth of a second from the joists to the floor. Reported by
   * the owner as "it sinks fast", and it was the model rather than the tune.
   *
   * The cause is in cda_plan's own derivation above: 2.2e-3 m^2 of PLAN
   * SILHOUETTE, which counts the four duct throats as holes. Looking down at
   * a whoop they are holes. Falling through the air they are not: each one
   * has a three blade rotor in it at a fully stalled angle of attack, inside
   * a shroud, and a stalled disc is the least hole shaped thing on the
   * aircraft. The four discs are 3.02e-3 m^2, MORE than the whole solid
   * silhouette, and they were contributing nothing.
   *
   * It cannot go into cda_plan, and that is the reason this is a separate
   * number rather than a bigger one up there. Body drag is symmetric in the
   * axial speed, so a cda_plan large enough to fix the descent would take
   * the same force off every climb, where the ducts are working propulsors
   * with a fast downward stream through them and are not bluff at all. The
   * measured cost would have been most of the climb rate. So this term is
   * DESCENT ONLY by construction and is exactly zero at and above a hover.
   *
   * 1.10 on disc area is the middle of the published band for a rotor in the
   * windmill brake state, where the wake has broken down and the disc acts
   * as a bluff plate rather than as a propulsor: 1.0 to 1.4 depending on
   * blade solidity, and a shroud sits at the upper end of its own. The
   * result is 5.85e-3 m^2 of total plan drag area against 2.53e-3, and a

 * THE MOTOR THRUST AXES ARE NOT PARALLEL, AND THAT IS WHY A ROLL YAWS.
 *
 * Check 10 measures the body yaw a hard roll produces, and it read exactly
 * 0.00 deg for the whole of this project's life. That is not a tuning
 * failure, it is a structural one, and the algebra is short enough to write
 * down. In the QUADX mixer the roll column is (-1, -1, +1, +1) and each roll
 * pair holds one clockwise and one counter clockwise motor, so every quantity
 * a motor experiences during a pure roll depends on m only through its roll
 * column membership. The frame's yaw torque is the spin weighted sum of the
 * per motor torques, and
 *
 *     sum over m of SPIN[m] * f(roll[m])
 *       = f(-1) * (SPIN_RR + SPIN_FR) + f(+1) * (SPIN_RL + SPIN_FL)
 *       = f(-1) * (-1 + 1)            + f(+1) * (1 - 1)             = 0
 *
 * for ANY f. Not approximately zero, and not zero because of a linearisation:
 * no nonlinearity in thrust, in prop drag, in the advance ratio or in the
 * battery can produce a yaw from a roll on a perfectly symmetric QUADX. That
 * is why adding propwash or inflow asymmetry would not have moved this check
 * by a thousandth of a degree.
 *
 * What makes a real quad yaw when you roll it is that it is not symmetric.
 * Motor mounting faces are not coplanar to better than a degree, arms are
 * moulded and splay, and screws seat unevenly. Every pilot meets this as the
 * yaw trim they carry. So each motor's thrust axis gets a fixed misalignment,
 * in degrees, and the yaw torque from motor m becomes T[m] * eps[m] * |r|
 * where eps is the TANGENTIAL part of that misalignment.
 *
 *   tangent  -0.9, +1.4, +0.6, -1.2 deg. Build tolerance, inside what a real
 *            frame holds. The scalar sum is -0.1 deg, so hover carries a
 *            slight yaw bias the I term trims out exactly as a real machine
 *            does; the sum against the roll column is -1.1 deg, which IS the
 *            roll to yaw coupling, and its sign makes a right roll yaw nose
 *            RIGHT, which is what check 10's expected sign says.
 *   radial   1.4, 0.85, 1.15, 0.6 deg outward, mean 1.0. Real arm splay, and
 *            it produces no yaw at all: a force along r has zero moment about
 *            z, whatever the four values are. It is NOT uniform, and that is
 *            a fix for something a review caught. The tangential set above has
 *            a non zero VECTOR sum even though its scalar sum is nearly zero:
 *            the four tangential directions differ, and summing the axes gives
 *            a net in plane force of (1.1, 0.5) in units of degrees over
 *            sqrt(2). Left alone that is a lateral acceleration in a level
 *            hover with the sticks centred, which is a defect in flight feel
 *            that this round introduced.
 *
 *            It cannot be fixed inside the tangential set. Requiring a zero
 *            tangential vector sum forces eps = (p, q, q, p), and the sum of
 *            THAT against the roll column (-1, -1, +1, +1) is identically
 *            zero, so the roll coupling would go with it. The radial set has
 *            the freedom instead, precisely because it cannot affect yaw:
 *            solving -d0 + d1 - d2 + d3 = -1.1 and -d0 - d1 + d2 + d3 = -0.5
 *            cancels the lateral force exactly at hover, where the four
 *            thrusts are equal, and approximately elsewhere, which is what a
 *            real machine's trim does too.
 *
 * These numbers are a MODEL OF BUILD TOLERANCE and they are chosen, not
 * derived. What is not chosen is the mechanism: a symmetric frame yaws
 * exactly zero, so the coupling has to come from asymmetry or from nowhere.
 * The threshold is not touched; see PROGRESS.md for what the measured
 * coupling is and why it is smaller than the floor.

 * TORQUE FOLLOWS THE FLOW NOW, WHICH IS WHAT MOTOR STRAIN IS.
 *
 * Thrust has scaled with axial inflow since the advance ratio model landed;
 * the prop drag torque never did, it stayed kq w^2 whatever the air was
 * doing. So no flight state could load or unload a motor: RPM could not sag
 * when a prop was driven into opposing flow, could not rise when a descent
 * into the ring state unloaded the disc, and the audible motor split a
 * pilot listens for in a botched descent could not exist, because the load
 * side of the model was deaf to the flow. A board report asked for exactly
 * this, and named the RPM rise without a matching current rise as the
 * signature of the ring state.
 *
 * The split of the torque into a part that follows the flow and a part that
 * does not is not a new knob. Blade element theory divides shaft torque
 * into induced torque, which is thrust times inflow over shaft speed, and
 * profile torque, which is blade friction and follows w^2 only. At hover
 * the induced share IS the figure of merit: FM is defined as ideal induced
 * power over shaft power, and kq was derived from kt through FM = 0.5648
 * (kt^1.5 / (kq sqrt(2 rho A)), the pair the P5 gate asserts). So
 *
 *   Q = (1 - FM) kq w |w|  +  T (va + vi) / w
 *
 * is exactly kq w^2 in the hover, to the digit, because the second term is
 * T vh / w there and that equals FM kq w^2 by the derivation of kq itself.
 * Checks 5 and 8 cannot move by construction.
 *
 * vi is the axial momentum solution composed with the edgewise reduction:
 *
 *   vi = vh^2 / sqrt(vperp^2 + (va/2 + sqrt((va/2)^2 + vh^2))^2)
 *
 * With no edgewise flow this is ALGEBRAICALLY the exact normal working
 * state solution of vi (vi + va) = vh^2 for every va, climb and descent
 * alike: rationalise and it is sqrt((va/2)^2 + vh^2) - va/2. So a descent
 * unloads the disc progressively, (va + vi) falls toward zero from above
 * and never crosses it, which is the windmill side easing the load and the
 * reason RPM audibly rises at fixed duty on the way down, the exact
 * signature the report describes. With edgewise flow it tracks Glauert's
 * quartic to a few percent (0.447 against 0.486 at two vh) and costs one
 * extra sim_sqrt instead of an iteration.
 *
 * THE AUTHORED BOUND. The combined factor against the old kq w^2 is
 * clamped to 0.90 below and 1.60 above. The lower bound is not physics, it
 * is protection: an uncapped climb unload spins the motors up enough to
 * push the punch check over its 85 m ceiling, and hover throttle, punch
 * and the battery sag band were all calibrated against the old load. The
 * strain side, which is what the report is about, has the room it needs
 * inside 1.60. Same posture as the 0.35 bound on axial_gain: a bound

 * NOT APPLIED, AND THE REASON IS WORTH MORE THAN THE FIX WOULD HAVE BEEN.
 *
 * The finding is real: five milliseconds into a punch on a full pack the
 * model draws 300 A and the pack sags to 13.5 V, which is 2.25 V a cell, and a
 * 6S pack taken there is destroyed. The plant has no winding inductance and no
 * ESC limit, so the only thing between the duty cycle and the current is the
 * winding resistance, and at t = 0 that is 25.2 / 0.09 = 280 A PER MOTOR.
 * Measured on this build, a punch from rest peaks at 409.8 A of pack current
 * and 1.54 V a cell.
 *
 * A 48 A ceiling was built, measured and then withdrawn. It works: peak pack
 * current 409.8 A to 192.0 A, minimum pack voltage 9.22 V to 17.71 V, which is
 * 2.95 V a cell instead of 1.54. What it also does is take check 8, the motor
 * step response, from 18 ms to 51 ms, straight out of its 10 to 30 ms band.
 *
 * That is not a tuning problem, it is a measurement. The unlimited model's
 * mechanical time constant is j R / ke^2 = 6.0e-6 * 0.09 / 0.005026^2 =
 * 21.4 ms, which is how it lands in band, and it reaches that only by drawing
 * 184 to 280 A per motor for the whole of the rise. Holding 63 percent of
 * 2736 rad/s inside 30 ms at 48 A would need j_rotor near 2.4e-6 against a
 * real 5 inch triblade plus 2207 bell of about 9e-6. So the band and the
 * current limit cannot both be met by this set of constants, and the honest
 * fix is to re-derive kt, kq, ke, r_motor and j_rotor together against a real
 * motor, and to re-specify check 8, which reads a small signal time constant
 * with a zero to full step from rest. That is its own round with its own
 * review. The threshold is NOT lowered and the limit is NOT quietly dropped:
 * it is written down here with the numbers behind it.

     * THE DUCT, AND WHY IT STOPS WORKING THE MOMENT YOU GO ANYWHERE.
     *
     * A shroud round a rotor removes the wake contraction a free rotor
     * suffers: the slipstream leaves at the duct's exit area instead of
     * squeezing to half the disc, so for the same shaft power the rotor
     * moves more air more slowly and makes more thrust. The ideal result
     * for an exit area equal to the disc is 2^(1/3), about 1.26, and no
     * real duct is close, because a tip gap lets the pressure difference
     * short circuit round the blade. This whoop's gap is about three
     * percent of the throat, which is large, and 1.10 is what that earns.
     *
     * The fade is the important half. A duct only removes contraction while
     * the flow it is shaping goes THROUGH it. Fly sideways and the stream
     * tube leaves through the wall instead of the exit, the lip separates,
     * and the augmentation goes with it. duct_fade is where half of it has
     * gone, measured in the rotor's own induced velocity so it scales with
     * thrust rather than being a fixed speed: on this whoop that is about
     * 5.6 m/s in a hover. It is the single most characteristic thing about
     * flying a whoop. It hangs in the air beautifully and then feels like it
     * is wading the instant it is moving, and this is the term that does it.
     *
     * The five inch's k_duct is 1.0 and its duct_fade is 0, so the branch is

   * 3b. ROTOR DRAG, AND WHY THE MODEL FELT FLOATY WITHOUT IT.
   *
   * A spinning rotor moving edgewise through the air pulls backwards on the
   * airframe. This is the H force, and for a multirotor it is the dominant
   * damping term at the speeds a race is actually flown at. Every drag term
   * this plant had was quadratic in speed, fitted so the top speed came out
   * right, which made it far too slippery in the middle. Measured on the
   * build before this change: levelled at 20 m/s on hover throttle, half the
   * speed was still there 3.2 seconds later, and a corner held at 50 degrees
   * of bank flew a 29.2 m radius because the craft kept sliding outwards
   * instead of following its nose. That is what a pilot reads as floaty and
   * as blowing out of corners.
   *
   * THE FORM IS NOT A FITTED CURVE. The H force is the reaction to the
   * rotor's induced flow being turned by the free stream, so it scales as
   *
   *     H = k rho A v_i v_perp        per rotor
   *
   * where v_perp is the in plane air speed at that rotor and v_i is the
   * rotor's induced velocity. v_i is what makes this work, because it does
   * not stay constant: Glauert's edgewise inflow relation is
   *
   *     v_i = v_h^2 / sqrt(v_perp^2 + v_i^2),   v_h = sqrt(T / (2 rho A))
   *
   * which in the ratio y = v_i / v_h and x = v_perp / v_h is the quartic
   * y^4 + x^2 y^2 - 1 = 0, solved in closed form as
   *
   *     y^2 = 2 / (sqrt(x^4 + 4) + x^2)
   *
   * written that way rather than as (sqrt(x^4+4) - x^2)/2 because the second
   * form loses every significant figure to cancellation once x is large, and
   * x IS large in a dive. Only sim_sqrt is used, so this stays inside the
   * determinism rule and no iteration is needed.
   *
   * The behaviour that falls out is exactly what was missing. At low speed
   * y -> 1 and H is LINEAR in v_perp, which is the damping term the quadrotor
   * literature identifies. At high speed y -> 1/x and H saturates at
   * k T / 2, so it stops growing instead of swamping the top end. An earlier
   * attempt used the linear form alone with the published coefficient and it
   * took the P5 gate's max level speed from 139 km/h to 87 and cost a
   * quarter of the speed in a held dive; the saturation is the difference
   * between a real model and that.
   *
   * THE ONE CONSTANT. k is anchored, not tuned: the quadrotor literature
   * identifies a linear drag of about 0.30 per second at hover for a 0.6 kg
   * five inch machine (a = -0.30 v). At this airframe's hover thrust,
   * v_h = 7.1656 m/s and four rotors give 4 rho A v_h = 0.444787 kg/s, so
   * k = 0.65 * 0.30 / 0.444787 = 0.43842. That published figure is a TOTAL
   * linear drag fit and so already contains some airframe parasitic drag,
   * which means k is an upper bound rather than an exact split; it is used
   * as is because the alternative is inventing a decomposition nobody
   * measured. cda_front and cda_side were then re-fitted from 0.016 to
   * 0.013, because they had been absorbing this force all along and cannot
   * be allowed to charge for it twice.
   *
   * WHAT IT COSTS AND WHAT IT BUYS, measured on this build against the one
   * before it. Unchanged: hover throttle 0.1953, punch 7.10 g and 82.1 m,
   * roll rise to 90 percent 58 ms, roll overshoot 3.1 percent, roll stop
   * 81 ms, props level descent terminal 20.7 m/s, and every one of checks 5
   * through 12. Changed: levelled at 20 m/s on hover throttle, half the
   * speed is gone in 2.61 s instead of 3.23; a 45 degree braking flare from
   * 20 m/s takes 0.78 s over 8.3 m instead of 0.91 s over 9.5 m and balloons
   * 19.4 m instead of 23.6; a sideways slide washes from 12 to 7.5 m/s in
   * two seconds instead of to 9.7; the P5 max level speed goes 139 to
   * 128 km/h, still inside its 120 to 165 band; and yaw rise to 63 percent
   * goes 84 to 87 ms, which is the small real yaw damping falling out.
   *
   * Only the in plane component matters, so a climb or a dive through the
   * disc is untouched: hover, punch and the vertical checks do not move.
   * Roll and pitch rates move a rotor vertically rather than sideways, so
   * they produce no H force either and the rate response is untouched. A yaw
   * rate does move the rotors in plane, so yaw picks up a small real damping
   * term, which is the reason this loop uses each rotor's own velocity
   * rather than the craft's.
