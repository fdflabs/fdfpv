 * which is the whole feature. With the zero this struct carried, the range
 * became the full 4.20 V, the attenuation reached 1.0 at full charge, and
 * motorRangeMax collapsed onto motorRangeMin: every motor pinned at idle,
 * which the owner flew and reported as "no throttle response at all" the
 * first time the key was set. The values below are Betaflight 4.5.1's own
