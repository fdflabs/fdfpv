/*
 * bf_glue.c: the seam between the simulator and the vendored Betaflight
 * sources, compiled against the real Betaflight headers with the SITL
 * target configuration.
 *
 * patches/0001 switches on the dynamic notch, the RPM filter and dynamic
 * idle for this target. All three are gated on DShot telemetry upstream,
 * which this build has no driver for and does not need: the plant knows every
 * rotor's speed exactly, and getMotorFrequencyHz below hands it over through
 * the same lag a real telemetry stream carries. Of the three, the RPM filter
 * and dynamic idle run; the dynamic notch declines to arm below a 2 kHz loop,
 * which is Betaflight's own rule and would apply to a real quad at this loop
 * rate too.
 *
 * Everything with control feel in it is Betaflight's own compiled code:
 * gyroUpdate and gyroFiltering (the gyro filter chain, lpf1, lpf2, the
 * static notches and the dynamic lpf), updateRcCommands and
 * processRcCommand (rc command handling, the rates curves and rc
 * smoothing), pidController (PID, D term filtering, feedforward, iterm
 * relax, anti gravity, TPA, D max), mixTable (mixer, airmode, throttle
 * boost, thrust linearisation) and applySimplifiedTuning (the slider
 * tuning the published race presets are written in).
 *
 * This file only provides the hardware abstraction layer STAGE1.md says
 * to stub: a gyro device read that returns the simulated body rates as
 * 16 bit counts exactly as Betaflight's own SITL target does, the motor
 * endpoint arithmetic that normally lives in drivers/dshot.c, the
 * battery sag reading, and (when ANGLE_MODE is on) the plant attitude
 * that pidLevel would otherwise read from the IMU. Config keys are
 * applied by bf_settings.c against the real parameter group structs.

/*
 * ---- GYRO VIBRATION, WITHOUT WHICH THE WHOLE FILTER CHAIN IS DECORATIVE ----
 *
 * The simulated gyro handed Betaflight the exact body rate. Measured in a
 * steady hover, the filtered gyro moved 0.0016 deg/s from one sample to the
 * next; a real 5 inch sits at 1 to 5 deg/s filtered and 20 to 100 raw. Three
 * things follow from a perfectly clean gyro and all of them are wrong:
 * gyro_lpf and dterm_lpf could only ever cost delay, so the sim rewarded
 * removing filters where a real quad punishes it; D term gain was free, so a
 * tune that felt good here would oscillate on a real machine; and nothing in
 * the model could tell you why anyone soft mounts a stack.
 *
 * WHAT IS MODELLED. Prop and bell imbalance shake the frame, the flight
 * controller is bolted to the frame, and the gyro measures that shake on top
 * of the body rate. So this is added to the SENSOR READING and not to the
 * plant's omega: the airframe is still a rigid body, and the only way the
 * vibration reaches the trajectory is the way it does in life, through the
 * controller reacting to it. Imbalance force goes as rotor speed squared, so
 * the amplitude is scaled by (w / w_full)^2 off the actual motor speeds,
 * which is why it is quiet in a hover and loud on the power.
 *
 * TWO PARTS, AND THE FIRST ONE IS THE POINT.
 *
 * Prop and bell imbalance is a once per revolution force, so it is a LINE at
 * each rotor's own frequency, not a hump. That matters beyond realism: a line
 * is what a dynamic notch hunts and what an RPM filter is aimed at, and a
 * model that only emits broadband hash gives neither of them anything to do.
 * Four rotors at four slightly different speeds put four moving lines in the
 * spectrum, which is exactly what a blackbox spectrogram of a real quad looks
 * like. Each is generated at its rotor's true frequency by integrating its
 * own phase, and the four carry different imbalance factors because no two
 * props are balanced alike. A rotating imbalance is inherently quadrature
 * between the two in plane axes, so roll takes the sine and pitch the cosine
 * of the same phase; yaw takes less, at 0.5, because the frame is stiffer
 * about that axis and it reaches the gyro through plate bending rather than
 * directly. That last split is a coupling model, not a derived modal
 * response, and is the one part of this that is chosen rather than physical.
 *
 * A 1 kHz gyro can represent nothing above 500 Hz. The prop fundamental runs
 * 130 Hz at idle to 426 Hz at full throttle, so the whole range fits under
 * Nyquist with room to spare. Blade passing at three times that does not, and
 * is not modelled: imbalance is once per rev and that is the term that
 * dominates a real spectrum anyway.
 *
 * The second part is a broad 80 to 350 Hz hump for frame modes and general
 * airframe hash, on the same one pole pair the propwash uses, coefficients
 * 1 - exp(-2 pi f dt) at dt = 1 ms.
 *
 * THE AMPLITUDE is set against the FILTERED figure, because that is what a
 * real blackbox log reports and so the only one that can be compared. A good
 * 5 inch reads 1 to 3 deg/s RMS of filtered gyro around cruise and 3 to 6 on
 * the power. 12 deg/s of broadband injection overshot that, measuring 4.21 at
 * 55 percent throttle and 7.35 at full. 5.0 of hump plus 3.0 of line still
 * read as a loose, unbalanced machine at full throttle on the sticks, which
 * a pilot flying this build named as too much shake rather than as a tight
 * race quad. 1.5 of hump and 0.8 of line was about a third of that energy:
 * the spectrum is still there for the filters to work on, the pad is still
 * not silent, and the video no longer swims on a punch. A tired set of
 * props runs several times either figure. On top sits a floor for the
 * sensor itself; 0.2 deg/s is roughly an ICM-42688 over a 500 Hz bandwidth.
 *
 * RAISED ONE SUBTLE STEP, owner's request, 2026-08-24. The Crapshack tune
 * entry recorded why maxed sliders feel too perfect here: the tunes real
 * quads fly pay for headroom against noise this gyro barely has. Measured
 * on the build before this change, filtered gyro noise RMS with the body
 * truth subtracted read 0.16 deg/s in the hover, 0.45 at 55 percent and
 * 1.03 at full throttle, a fifth to a sixth of the real quad band above.
 * The step is 1.5 to 2.0 of hump, 0.8 to 1.0 of line and 0.20 to 0.30 of
 * floor, about forty percent more energy, chosen deliberately small: the
 * last time these numbers moved it was DOWN, from a pilot calling 5.0 and
 * 3.0 too much shake, and the instruction here is to start subtle and let
 * the pilot say more. The floor matters most of the three at low stick,
 * where the D term lives; 0.30 is still inside what a 42688 reads at its
 * wider bandwidth settings on a warm board.
 *
 * The RMS divisor is MEASURED, not estimated: 0.340474 over eight million
 * samples of this exact recursion, peak 2.92 sigma, so unlike the propwash
 * channel it needs no clamp. The propwash comment records what happens when
 * that number is guessed instead.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. Its own xorshift32 seed, integer operations only, reset with
 * the rest of the controller state in bridge_reset.

   * THE TWO FEATURE FLAGS THAT DO NOTHING UNTIL SOMETHING RUNS THEM.
   *
   * Setting a bit in enabledFeatures is not what turns a Betaflight feature
   * on. Two of them are latched into runtime state by fc/core.c, which this
   * build does not compile, so both sat off for the whole of this project's
   * life while the config said they were on.
   *
   * Airmode: mixer.c asks airmodeIsEnabled(), which returns a static in
   * rc_modes.c written only by updateActivatedModes(). With it false,
   * applyMixerAdjustment scales roll and pitch mix authority by
   * scaleRangef(throttle, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0), so the craft had between 52 and
   * 100 percent of its authority depending on where the throttle stick was.
   * Measured on the mixer: peak split 0.472 duty at 2 percent throttle and
   * 0.945 above half, tracing that ramp exactly. A full roll step at 25
   * percent throttle rose to 90 percent in 59 ms against 45 ms at 55 percent.
   * That is the mushiness on a chop, and it is not what a real quad does.
   *
   * Anti gravity: pidRuntime.antiGravityEnabled is set only by
   * pidSetAntiGravityState from core.c. It is called here with the same
   * expression core.c uses, minus the aux switch this build has no channels
   * for. Must come after pidInit, which owns pidRuntime.
   *
   * And featureInit, which is the link that made the first attempt at this
   * fix change nothing at all. featureIsEnabled reads runtimeFeatureMask, a
   * static that only featureInit copies enabledFeatures into; fc/init.c calls
   * it on hardware and nothing called it here, so the mask was zero and every
   * feature in this build has always read as off. Assigning FEATURE_AIRMODE
   * in bf_config_begin was therefore never enough on its own.
   *
   * updateActivatedModes is Betaflight's own function rather than a local
   * assignment so that aux driven modes work unchanged the day this build
   * gets aux channels. With no mode activation conditions analysed its loops
   * are empty and it reduces to the airmode line.
