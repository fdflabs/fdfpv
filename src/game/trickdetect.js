/*
 * trickdetect.js: what the pilot just did, named.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. Tony Hawk knows what trick you did because you pressed the
 * button for it. An FPV quad has four analogue channels and no trick button,
 * so the trick has to be READ BACK out of the flight. This file reads it.
 *
 * THE METHOD, and it is deliberately the dullest one that works. Betaflight
 * and the plant already agree on body angular rate, p q r in rad/s, and a
 * trick in the freestyle vocabulary is almost always a whole number of
 * quarter turns about ONE body axis. So:
 *
 *   1. Integrate each body rate into a signed angle. A "run" opens when the
 *      rate crosses RATE_ON and closes when it falls under RATE_OFF and
 *      stays there, or when it changes sign.
 *   2. On close, divide by a turn and snap to the nearest quarter. The
 *      craft's own attitude at that moment settles the ambiguous cases: a
 *      roll that ends upright is a whole number of turns and a roll that
 *      ends inverted is a half, whatever the integral says to three decimal
 *      places. That check is what makes this robust to a pilot who
 *      overshoots, which is every pilot.
 *   3. That is a PRIMITIVE: one axis, a signed quarter-turn count, a start
 *      and end time, and how long the craft was stalled before it began.
 *   4. Match a buffer of primitives against a table of patterns, longest
 *      first. Three primitives reading half roll, whole flip, half roll the
 *      same way round is a Rubik's Cube and is worth 325, where the same
 *      three scored separately are worth 200. Longest match wins, which is
 *      the whole reason the buffer exists.
 *
 * WHY INTEGRATING RATE AND NOT READING THE QUATERNION. Body rotations do not
 * commute, so this integral is not the geometric angle when two axes move at
 * once, and it drifts on a badly coordinated trick. That is not a defect
 * here: it is what the pilot's own gyro sees, it is what an OSD flip counter
 * counts, and it is what a judge watching the video counts. A quaternion
 * difference cannot tell a 360 roll from a 720 at all, because both end
 * level. Counting is the right operation.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO YET, and none of it is hidden. Everything in the
 * catalogue that needs to know about an OBSTACLE is out of reach: a
 * Powerloop is a flip around something, a Matty is a flip over something, a
 * Wall Tap needs a wall. The catalogue carries all 90 of them; this file
 * recognises the ones that are pure air. Obstacle awareness is stage 2 and
 * the shape it needs is written down in PROGRESS.md. A trick this file
 * cannot name is not scored, rather than being scored as something else.
 *
 * NO TRIGONOMETRY. There is not a sin, cos, atan or pow in this file. The
 * attitude test is one polynomial in the quaternion's components and the
 * turn count is a division by a constant, so the same recording names the
 * same tricks in Node and in a browser, which is what makes the self-test in
 * scripts/score-selftest.js mean anything.
 *
 * Units: SI in, per CLAUDE.md. Rates are rad/s, times are seconds at the
 * boundary and milliseconds inside where a threshold reads better as 500
 * than as 0.5. Rotation is counted in TURNS.

 * THE RATE GATE WAS IN THE WRONG UNIT, AND IT MADE THE ORBIT IMPOSSIBLE.
 *
 * Angular rate is tangential speed OVER RADIUS, so a threshold written in
 * turns per second says "the wider the circle, the faster you must fly".
 * That is backwards: a wide orbit is the harder trick, not the lesser one.
 * At 0.35 turns/s a lap had to close in 2.9 seconds, which a powerloop does
 * and NO ORBIT EVER DOES. Measured, two laps of a pole: 5.0 s named Orbit
 * x2 ten times out of ten, 7.0 s named NOTHING ten times out of ten, at
 * every radius from 3 to 12 m and with up to 50 degrees of nose wander. The
 * cutoff sat exactly on 0.35 turns/s and had nothing to do with how well
 * the orbit was flown. That is the owner's "orbits and trippy spin are not
 * picking up at all", and it was never a tolerance problem.
 *
 * So the opening test is now the two questions separately. PATH_RATE_ON is
 * only "is this going round at all", low enough for a 12 second lap, and
 * PATH_TANGENT_ON is the one with the physics in it: metres per second
 * around the axis, which a craft hovering beside a post and drifting cannot
 * reach and a craft flying round it always can, at any radius.
 *
 * The floors that actually keep a fly past out are the WINDING TOTALS, not
 * this: a straight line subtends strictly less than half a turn about any
 * point off it, and POLE_MIN_TURNS, HALF_LAP_MIN and WHOLE_LAP_MIN are all

 *
 * It was 0.12 against an ON gate of 0.08, so the pair was INVERTED: a lap

 * close it. Every other run in this file has the hysteresis the right way
 * round, RATE_ON 3.0 against RATE_OFF 1.2, and the comment above this one

 *
 * What it costs is the WIDE SLOW orbit, which is the harder trick and the

 * on, and that is a comparison between two candidates, which the margin

 *
 * 0.9 refused real readings. An Inverted 360 Powerloop owns 0.87 and a

 * the axis sweeps EXACTLY half a turn, so the honest loop and the dishonest

 * only on where the craft entered the loop, so a tightly flown, well centred
 * one is thrown away and a loose one is kept. That is the same "a better
 * flown trick scoring less than a worse one" failure snapPathTurns already
 * records once.
 *
 * The radius is the quantity that should decide it. Going AROUND something
 * means staying at roughly one distance from it: measured on twelve real
 * city bars, a flown half loop breathes between 1.41 and 1.59, max over
 * min. Going PAST something means the distance has a sharp minimum at the
 * closest approach and grows at both ends, which is the theorem's own fact
 * said in a quantity that does not run out at a half turn.
 *
 * SO WHY IS THE FLOOR STILL 0.55. Because lowering it means the ratio has
 * to carry the weight instead, and the three flights it would have to
 * reject were measured on the REAL AIRCRAFT, not constructed: a ballistic
 * fall past a railing at 0.463, a straight descending pass at 0.500, a
 * straight climb at 0.377. Their radius ratios have not been measured. A
 * constructed straight pass does not reproduce them, because the rate gate
 * throws it out before it becomes a lap at all, so the number cannot be
 * had from a rig. Setting the threshold without it would be picking a
 * number to make a check pass, and then editing the checks that measured
 * those flights to accommodate it.
 *
 * The ratio is therefore TRACKED and carried out on every lap, and nothing
 * reads it yet. Fly the three cases on the real aircraft, read
 * `radiusRatio` off the primitive, and if the populations separate the

 * the craft has already crossed from under the rail to over it. Read

   * THIS USED TO BE A THREE STEP PATTERN and it is now one, which is the
   * same correction TRACK_DOT records for the Orbit. The workbook writes
   * the trick as "180 Pitch/Roll to invert, an inverted 360 Yaw spin, then
   * a Flip/Roll in the same direction", and the pattern followed it
   * literally: half a roll, a yaw, half a roll back the SAME way. So it
   * asked the entry and the exit to prove the craft was upside down,
   * because at the time nothing measured whether it actually was. A pilot
   * who rolled in one way and out the other, which is the ordinary way to
   * do it, scored 50 for a Yaw Spin.
   *
   * A rotation now carries the fraction of itself flown belly up, the same
   * way a lap has since INVERTED_MIN was written, so the craft's own
   * attitude answers the question and the entry and the exit are free to be
   * whatever the pilot flew. They are still paid for: a half roll either
   * side is a building block worth 50 each, exactly as it is anywhere else.
   *
   * NO `inverted: false` ON THE UPRIGHT ONE, because it does not need it.
   * Both patterns are one step long and both match an inverted spin, and
   * bestMatch takes the higher priced of two matches of equal length. An
   * ordinary yaw spin has an inverted fraction near zero and never reaches

 * that the rotation covers wins, and the remainder is handed back to the

 * with 180 degrees thrown away.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY MISSING, and it is the single most important
 * judgement call in this file. The workbook prices a 1/4 Roll at 25 and a
 * 1/2 Yaw Spin at 50, and this table used to hand those out. Flying the real
 * aircraft through six hard corners then scored TWELVE tricks: a quarter
 * roll and a half yaw spin per corner, from a pilot who was turning a
 * corner. That is not a fault in the workbook. Those blocks exist so a JUDGE
 * can price a custom trick a competitor DECLARED, and a competitor does not
 * declare "I banked into a turn".
 *
 * So the floor is drawn where a rotation stops being incidental:
 *
 *   yaw          only a WHOLE turn. Half a yaw spin is turning around to
 *                fly backwards, which every pilot does every few seconds.
 *   roll, pitch  a half turn or more. You do not end up inverted by
 *                accident; you do bank to 90 degrees and pitch 90 down
 *                into a dive constantly.
 *
 * Quarter turns are still matched INSIDE a pattern if a trick ever calls
 * for one. They are simply not worth anything on their own. A rotation that
 * finds no entry here is dropped rather than scored as something smaller,

   * A straight line subtends STRICTLY LESS THAN half a turn about any point
   * not on it. That is exact, not a tuning claim: as the craft runs from one
   * end of an infinite straight line to the other, the radius vector to a
   * fixed point sweeps from one asymptote to the other, and those asymptotes
   * are anti-parallel. Half a turn is the supremum and it is never reached.
   *
   * So any lap reading at or under half a turn is consistent with the craft
   * having flown DEAD STRAIGHT past the obstacle, and is therefore no
   * evidence at all of having gone around it. Going around something means
   * curving around it, and curving is precisely what buys the extra angle.
   *
   * This is not a threshold moved to make a test pass. It is the reason the
   * first version of this file was wrong, and it was wrong in three places
   * at once, all found by flying:
   *
   *   a quad DESCENDING in a straight line past a footbridge rail scored a
   *   Beginner Matty, because a descending pass really does cross from over
   *   the rail to under it, and the old floor of 0.375 turns let the 0.5 a
   *   straight line gives sail through;
   *   a quad falling ballistically past a railing, throttle at 0.05, with a
   *   lazy 0.37 of roll and pitch on the way down, scored a CLEAN Split-S;
   *   a quad CLIMBING straight past a rail scored an Immelmann Turn.
   *
   * Measured on the real aircraft: those false laps read 0.377 to 0.463
   * turns, all of them hugging the old floor from above. An honest flown
   * Immelmann reads 0.610 and an honest flown Split-S reads 0.82 to 0.85,
   * because the craft physically curves around the axis. The two
   * populations do not overlap and the boundary between them is the
   * theorem's own 0.5, with a little margin for the rate gate truncating
   * the tail of a real lap.

 * THE PATH, MEASURED FROM THE PATH.
 *
 * Everything above this line that concerns an obstacle measures a LAP as the
 * winding of the craft's position about a line derived from the colliders.
 * That has been the shape of the path side since it was written, and four
 * rounds of this log have now found faults that all trace back to it rather
 * than to any threshold:
 *
 *   a trick can only exist where the derivation found an axis, so a Split-S
 *   over a wall, a roof edge or a building corner is unnameable, and the
 *   catalogue's own open air blocks, Split-S at 100 and the quarter, half
 *   and three quarter Power Loops, are unreachable by construction;
 *   the lap's concurrent rotation is a BODY integral that has to be repaired
 *   afterwards by de-banking, with a sign convention measured per lap,
 *   because body axes tumble with the craft;
 *   and the straight line theorem, which is what refuses a fly past, runs
 *   out exactly where it is needed: a straight line subtends a supremum of
 *   half a turn about a point off it, and a perfect half loop sweeps exactly
 *   half a turn, so the honest trick and the dishonest fly past meet at the
 *   same number from opposite sides. The file says so itself, at length,
 *   above HALF_LAP_MIN.
 *
 * This measures the PATH instead, and the last of those three is the reason
 * it is worth the rewrite. The turning of the flight path is not a quantity
 * a straight line has any of: a craft flying dead past an object turns
 * through nothing at all, whatever the object subtends, while a half loop
 * turns through exactly half a turn wherever it is flown and whatever is or
 * is not inside it. The two populations stop overlapping, so the floors stop
 * being a coin toss.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED, and all of it from the craft's own trajectory and its
 * own frame, with no derived geometry in it:
 *
 *   turns     how far the flight path turned, from the integral of the
 *             tangent's own rotation
 *   axis      which way that turning pointed: horizontal is a loop in a
 *             vertical plane, vertical is an orbit in a horizontal one
 *   loop      the craft's rotation ABOUT the path's own turning axis, which
 *             is what a Powerloop has one of and a Maverick Loop none of,
 *             and which is bank independent because the axis is the path's
 *             and not the body's
 *   rollT     the craft's rotation about its own VELOCITY, which is the half
 *             roll of a Split-S, an Immelmann and a Juicy Flick
 *   spin      the craft's rotation about world up, which is the yaw of a
 *             Cinnamon Roll or an Inverted 360 Powerloop
 *   loopOn    whether the turning axis lies along the nose or across it,
 *             which is the whole of the difference between the Powerloop
 *             family and the Maverick family
 *   forward   the mean of nose against direction of travel: a Matty Flip
 *             comes out backwards and a Split-S comes out forwards
 *   object    whether anything solid is inside the circle the craft flew
 *
 * NO TRIGONOMETRY, the same rule the rest of the file keeps: cross products,
 * dot products and square roots only, so the same recording names the same
 * tricks in Node and in a browser.
 *
 * THE ANGULAR VELOCITY IS TAKEN FROM THE FRAME, NOT FROM THE GYRO, and that
 * is deliberate. The body rates arrive in Betaflight's own sign convention
 * and the body axes arrive in the renderer's, and the one thing this file
 * has been bitten by more than any other is a sign that was assumed to
 * relate the two. For an orthonormal frame the angular velocity is
 * one half the sum of e cross e-dot over the three axes, which uses only the
 * OBSERVED rotation of the frame the caller already passes. It needs no
 * convention to be agreed, so there is none to get wrong.

   * THE LOOP'S TURN BELONGS TO THE LOOP, NOT TO THE BANK IT WAS FLOWN AT.
   *
   * A lap's concurrent rotation used to be the plain time integral of the
   * BODY rates. Body axes tumble with the craft, so that is not "turns about
   * each axis": it is the craft's real rotation projected onto a frame that
   * is itself rotating, and for the loop family the error is not a subtle
   * second order term, it is a first order one with a closed form.
   *
   * Fly a Powerloop. The nose stays tangent, so the rail's axis is
   * perpendicular to the nose, but it sits at the BANK ANGLE phi in the
   * plane of the wing and the up axis. The gyro therefore reads
   *
   *     q = Omega cos(phi),   r = Omega sin(phi)
   *
   * and the integral comes out rot = [0, cos(phi), sin(phi)], whose pitch
   * and yaw always square to one. At 45 degrees of bank, which is ordinary
   * when the rail sits diagonal to the approach, that is [0, 0.71, 0.71]:
   * Powerloop pays one slack for a pitch error of 0.29, Donkey Loop pays one
   * for a yaw error of 0.29, they tie on length and slack, and Donkey Loop
   * is worth 600 against Powerloop's 200 so the dearer name wins. The pilot
   * never touched the yaw stick and the craft never changed heading in any
   * world sense. Past about 41 degrees of bank a Powerloop WAS a Donkey Loop.
   *
   * So the loop's own turn is measured where it actually happens, about the
   * OBSTACLE'S axis, which is bank independent; the body integrals have that
   * turn subtracted out, leaving what the PILOT added; and the loop's turn is
   * then put back on whichever body axis its axis most lies along. A lap
   * flown nose across the rail lands it on pitch, which is a Powerloop; nose
   * along the rail lands it on roll, which is the Mavvy family; and a genuine
   * yaw spin inside the loop survives in the residual, which is what makes a
   * real Donkey Loop still a Donkey Loop.
   *
   * Falls back to the raw body integral when the caller supplied no up axis,
   * which is every test written before this existed and the safe way round.

   * A powerloop round the practice rail wound 1.34 turns, snapped to 1, and

 * Everything above this line reads a flight and turns it into quarter turns
 * and laps. This is the other half of the job and it was missing: deciding
 * whether what the pilot flew IS the trick, when nobody flies a trick to the
 * quarter turn.
 *
 * The old matcher tested `p.turns !== s.turns` and gave up. So a 360 roll
 * that came out at 450 because the pilot held the stick a beat too long was
 * not a Roll, it was a Roll and a 1/4 Roll, and a Rubik's Cube whose middle
 * flip overshot was three building blocks. The pilot flew the trick and was
 * told they flew parts.
 *
 * THE WORKBOOK ALREADY HAS THE ANSWER AND IT IS NOT A WIDER THRESHOLD. It
 * grades every trick CLEAN, SLOPPY, BUMP, MISSED or CRASH, and SLOPPY costs
 * 35% for a trick that was completed but "lacks constant loop motion,
 * execution is too segmented". A trick flown a quarter turn out is exactly
 * that: completed, and not clean. So a step may match LOOSELY at a cost of
 * one slack point, the trick is still named, and any slack at all grades it
 * SLOPPY. Nothing is widened; a second, cheaper grade is opened underneath.
 *
 * WHAT NEVER GETS SLACK, and this is what keeps it honest:
 *
 *   the axis     a roll is not a flip, at any tolerance
 *   the direction  sameAs, oppTo and dir are what separate a Rubik's Cube
 *                from a rewind and an Invert Rewind from Segmented Flips.
 *                A trick defined by going back the other way cannot be
 *                allowed to match going the same way, however sloppily
 *   which kind   a lap is not a rotation
 *
 * Only MAGNITUDES are slackened: how far it turned, how much it turned
