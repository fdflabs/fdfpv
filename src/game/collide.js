 * collide.js: what the craft can hit, and whether it just hit it.
 *
 * Until this file existed the only solid thing in the world was the ground,
 * and it was solid in the crudest way: one point test against the terrain
 * height, no craft radius, no sweep. A gate was a scoring plane you could
 * fly straight through the middle of the frame, a tree was a picture, and a
 * cliff was scenery. The owner's words were "the gates need to be solid".
 *
 * ONE PRIMITIVE. Every solid thing in this world is a capsule: a segment
 * from a to b, plus a radius. A tree trunk is a vertical capsule, a gate
 * cross member is a horizontal one, a canopy blob is a capsule whose
 * segment has zero length, which is a sphere. Choosing one primitive means
 * one test, and one test that is correct is worth more than four that are
 * nearly correct.
 *
 * THE TEST IS EXACT, NOT SAMPLED. A sphere of radius CRAFT_WORLD_R swept along
 * the segment the craft travelled this frame intersects a capsule exactly
 * when the distance between the two segments is at most the sum of the two
 * radii. So the query is a segment to segment closest distance, which is
 * closed form. The first design for this sampled the travel at 0.1 m steps,
 * which needed a cap on the sample count, and the cap would have been a
 * tunnelling bug on any machine slower than the cap assumed. This container
 * renders at about two frames a second, so the craft can move fifteen
 * metres between frames, and a sampled sweep would have been wrong here
 * before it was ever wrong on real hardware.
 *
 * THE QUERY ALLOCATES NOTHING. Budget P8 says zero new objects in the
 * render loop and it is already failing; this is called every frame and
 * must not make it worse. Colliders live in flat Float32Arrays, the
 * broadphase grid holds Int32Arrays, and the duplicate rejection is a stamp
 * array rather than a Set. There is no array literal, no object literal and
 * no closure anywhere in hit().
 *
 * Everything here is in Three.js world space, y up, downstream of the
 * physics. The query itself does not write the plant. It reports a unit
 * outward normal and a closing parameter; the shell may call sim_contact
 * with those so a clip bounces, slides or rolls instead of tunnelling.

 * beyond it. The disc a tumbling quad sweeps is the sum. Check 15
 * publishes that radius. The query itself is the four prop discs, not a
 * sphere, because a wall the craft meets square-on sees 0.141 m, not
 * 0.1735 m.
 *
 * THE OLD NUMBER WAS WRONG BY 8.6 PERCENT AND A SCALE CHECK IS WHAT CAUGHT IT.
 * CRAFT_R was typed as 0.1885, derived in its own comment from a 250 mm class
 * quad with a motor 0.125 m out. This airframe is not 250 mm: plant.c puts
 * the motors at arm_x = arm_y = 0.110 / sqrt(2), which is 0.110 m from the
 * centre and a 220 mm machine, and src/render/craft.js draws them there. So
 * the collision sphere was 0.1885 m around a craft that sweeps 0.1735 m, and
 * every gate in the course was scored against a quad 8.6 percent bigger than
 * the one on screen. It is derived here now, from the same two numbers the

 * square-on sees 0.141 m, the motor's axis offset plus the blade. Sweeping
 * CRAFT_R in every horizontal direction treated the empty air between the

 * the airframe on screen, and the whole machine read as a ball.
 * Vertically the hull is NOT symmetric about the CG and this used to pretend
 * it was. It was one number, `vHalf`, chosen to cover whichever extent was
 * larger and then mirrored, which costs nothing on a craft that is about as
 * deep below as it is tall above and a great deal on one that is not. The

 * The plant resolves an obstacle contact with one impulse at one point.
 * Which point decides how much of that impulse becomes rotation: the
 * angular term is about two thirds of the effective mass at a full arm,
 * so the arm is not a detail, it is most of the answer. sim_contact
 * picked the hull OBB's support in the -n direction, and that support is
 * always an extreme corner, every half extent at once. A belly slapped
 * flat on a wall therefore solved as a corner strike, came out still
 * moving into the face, and picked up tens of radians a second of spin
 * out of a contact that should have produced none. Measured before this
 * existed: a 6 m/s flat arrival left at -4.4 m/s, still inbound, with
 * 41 rad/s of spin it did not arrive with.
 *
 * A real airframe meets a flat face on a patch, not a point. The shape
 * this file sweeps is already the four prop discs, so the patch is the
 * discs that are actually against the surface, and its centroid is the
 * honest place to put the impulse:
 *
 *   belly flat on a wall   four discs tied      centroid under the CG,
 *                                               no moment, it pushes off
 *   square into a wall     two discs tied       centroid on the centreline,
 *                                               no moment, it stops square
 *   one arm catches        one disc deepest     full moment, it spins
 *
 * which is what those three contacts do in the world.
 *
 * This is a patch CENTROID, not a support function, and the two differ on
 * purpose. Along the body axis the term is scaled by d . u rather than
 * its sign, so a craft that meets a wall edge on (d perpendicular to u)
 * contributes nothing there instead of half the body depth: taking the
 * sign would put the impulse a body half-height off the centreline and
 * invent exactly the moment this function exists to remove.
 *
 * Returns the offset from the craft centre to that centroid, in world
 * metres, written into out. Allocation free: called from the contact
 * pass, which runs on the sim clock.
 */
/* How close to the deepest disc another disc must be to count as sharing
 * the patch. A 220 mm airframe on a flat face ties all four inside a few

 * A ROTOR PRESSED INTO A SURFACE CANNOT PULL AIR THROUGH IT.
 *
 * The report: "if you hit a wall i think its programmed to kick you off
 * like a pinball but it creates a situation where you constantly just get
 * stuck between 2 spots and bounce forever, constantly have to restart."
 *
 * Both halves of that sentence are one fault, and it is not restitution.
 * The contact impulse lands at the support point of the hull in the
 * direction of the face, and for a craft with any tilt at all that point
 * sits off the centre of mass on the side it is already tilted toward, so
 * the torque tilts it FURTHER. Measured on the training wall through
 * scripts/wall-check.js, with the normal impulse taken as one unit:
 *
 *     pitch      2 deg      -0.003      nose down
 *     pitch     30 deg      -0.053      nose down
 *     pitch     60 deg      -0.104      nose down
 *     pitch     80 deg      -0.132      nose down
 *     pitch     90 deg       0.000      the fixed point
 *
 * Monotonic, one signed, and zero only where the thrust axis has come
 * round square to the face. It is a ratchet with one stop in it, and the
 * stop is the attitude the pilot cannot fly out of.
 *
 * What happens at the stop is what the report describes. A level 6 m/s
 * arrival winds to 90 degrees nose down in about six tenths of a second,
 * and the craft is then holding its own thrust axis INTO the wall at
 * whatever throttle the pilot has in. At centred sticks the discs make
 * close to three times hover thrust pressed against the face, the wall's
 * own mu of 0.42 then holds 8.2 N against a 6.9 N aircraft, and the craft
 * hangs there taking a contact every twenty milliseconds, buzzing in and
 * out of the 8 mm separation: the two spots.
 * Flown in the rig, every stick a pilot has (full pitch either way, full
 * roll, hard yaw, full throttle) leaves it inside a centimetre of the face
 * after two whole seconds. It is not hard to leave, it cannot be left.
 *
 * None of the four clip-watch detectors sees it either. The centre is not
 * inside a solid, the bounce loop resolves every pass, the terrain is
 * nowhere near, and the thrash gate wants a spin or real throttle and gets
 * a craft sitting quietly at hover. So the pilot restarts, which is the
 * complaint.
 *
 * THE MISSING PHYSICS IS THE ROTORS, and the module already has the entry
 * point for it. A propeller makes thrust by accelerating air through the
 * disc. Press that disc flat onto masonry and there is no air to take: the
 * inflow is blocked, the blades are striking, and thrust collapses. The
 * simulation had the discs pressed against the wall at 12,600 rpm making
 * full thrust, which is the only reason the craft could hold itself there.
 * sim_prop_strike takes rotor speed out for exactly this reason, and the
 * shell already calls it on the bang of an arrival; what was missing is
 * that a rotor held against a surface keeps losing, for as long as it is
 * held.
 *
 * So: while a resolved contact's outward normal opposes the craft's own
 * thrust axis, the rotors bleed. Everything else is untouched, and the
 * test is the sign of one dot product:
 *
 *   thrust into the face      n . up <= -PRESS_UP_DOT     bleeds
 *   belly or side on a wall   n . up  >  0                a wall ride, free
 *   sitting on a roof         n . up ~ +1                 a perch, free
 *   pressed up on a ceiling   n . up ~ -1                 bleeds, correctly
 *
 * PRESS_UP_DOT is a 60 degree cone, the same number PROP_PLANE_MAX_UP_DOT
 * already uses to mean "the disc plane is against this", so a craft banked
 * through a gate is nowhere near it.
 *
 * PRESS_CONFIRM_MS is a tenth of a second and a half of being held. A tap,
 * a graze and a clipped gate are all over long before it, so nothing a
 * pilot does on purpose pays for this; only being held against a face
 * does. It is counted in sim milliseconds of the HELD STATE, not in
 * contacts: a pinned craft buzzes in and out of the 8 mm separation and
 * only actually touches on about one pass in six, so counting passes with
 * a contact in them would never reach any threshold worth setting.
 * PRESS_RELEASE_MS is what ends the hold, and it is three times the
 * measured buzz gap, so leaving the face ends it and buzzing against it
 * does not.
 *
 * PRESS_BLEED is per contact pass, so it compounds against the motor's own
 * spin up. The rotors recover about a fifth of the gap to the commanded
 * speed in each 4 ms pass (t63 is 18 ms), which puts the steady state at
 * 0.2k / (1 - 0.8k) of commanded for k = 1 - PRESS_BLEED: 0.53 of the
 * speed at 0.15, and thrust goes as the square, so 0.28 of the thrust. A
 * craft pinned at full throttle presses with about nine times its weight
 * and needs to fall under about a quarter of that before mu stops holding
 * it, which is what 0.15 buys and 0.10 does not.
 *
 * CRASHFLIP IS EXEMPT, and it has to be. Turtle mode's whole method is to
 * drive two rotors against whatever the craft is lying on, and a craft
 * upside down on a rooftop reads exactly like a craft pinned on a wall:
 * the roof's normal is up, the thrust axis is down, the dot product is
 * minus one. Bleeding there would take away the one control that gets the
 * pilot out of it. The shell gates on sim_crashflip_active(), which is
 * true for both the scripted turtle and the held key.

 * arithmetic reduces to the constant it replaced and no lap time moves.
 *
 * It was a flat 0.22 m for every aircraft, and on the RaceGOW class it was
 * three and a half times too big. A whoop gate's bottom bar is ON THE FLOOR
 * and its opening is 0.711 m, so a flat band called the bottom 31 percent of

 * gate, which is the line a whoop is FOR, was refused the pass. Refused
 * silently: no flash, no gate tone, no mark on the OSD, because a refusal
 * here is indistinguishable from never having flown the gate. The pilot's
 * report was that whoop gates sometimes do not register, and this is the
 * whole of it. The start gate is a ground gate too, so on a low launch the

 * What the band means is that the craft cannot be flying clean this close to

 * which is what 0.22 m was for the five inch and what this says in general.

 * engine dependent. There is no sin or cos in the compiled libm to route
 * it through either, because the plant does not own one: sim_sqrt is the

 *   sqrt(q) = normalise(q.w + 1, q.x, q.y, q.z)
 *
 * Halve the relative rotation N times to get d^(1/2^N), and any dyadic
 * power d^(k/2^N) is the product of the halvings named by the set bits of
 * k. Quantising t onto that grid costs 1/1024 of the flip, which is a
 * third of a millisecond of a 380 ms animation, and buys an interpolation
 * that is bit-identical on every engine.

 * velocity, so the flip does not rush its own middle.
