/*
 * trackdoc.js: read a track document and hand back a course the field can
 * build.
 *
 * This is the seam between the track builder and the game, and it is the
 * only one. The builder writes a document; schema.md describes it; this file
 * reads it. Nothing else in the game knows the document exists.
 *
 * THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPENDENCY IS DELIBERATE AND IT IS ONE WAY. This
 * module imports the builder's model.js, elements.js, geometry.js and
 * path.js, which are pure data and pure functions: no DOM, no canvas, no
 * Three.js, no imports of their own outside that set. The ground-mark
 * builder in guide.js is the same kind of thing, and lives on this side
 * of the seam so the renderer never has to read a document. The builder
 * still imports nothing from the game and must not. The alternative, a second
 * implementation of normalize() and of the aperture maths living here, is
 * exactly the drift schema.md exists to prevent: two readers of one format
 * disagreeing about what a tilted gate means is a bug nobody would find
 * until a course flew wrong.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO: it does not touch Three.js and it does not
 * place anything. It converts frames, applies the game's obstacle scale, and
 * returns plain data. src/render/scene.js does the building.
 *
 * THE TWO FRAMES.
 *
 *   Document: right handed, Z up, origin at the field's near left corner,
 *   so every point has x in [0, width] and y in [0, depth].
 *   Scene: Three.js, Y up, origin at the middle of the world.
 *
 * The conversion is the same one the builder's own 3D preview makes, and it
 * happens here exactly once:
 *
 *   sceneX =  docX - width / 2
 *   sceneZ = -(docY - depth / 2)
 *   sceneY =  terrain(sceneX, sceneZ) + docZ
 *
 * so a document's field is centred on the world's origin and its base
 * heights are measured from the ground under them. The Y is not applied
 * here, because the terrain is not known until the height field has been
 * built from the course this file returns. The scene adds it.
