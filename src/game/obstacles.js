/*
 * obstacles.js: the things in the world you can fly a trick AROUND.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE HAS TO EXIST. src/game/trickdetect.js reads tricks out of
 * the craft's own rotation, and that is enough for the whole Open Air
 * category and nothing else. Every remaining trick in the catalogue is
 * defined against an OBJECT: a Powerloop is a flip around something, a
 * Matty is a flip over something, a Split-S goes over and comes back under,
 * an Orbit goes round and round. Without a list of objects and where their
 * axes are, none of them can be named, because the rotation of a Powerloop
 * and the rotation of a plain Flip are identical. The difference is
 * entirely in where the craft WENT.
 *
 * WHAT AN OBSTACLE IS, AND WHY IT IS AN AXIS. The one thing all of those
 * tricks have in common is that the craft WINDS AROUND A LINE:
 *
 *   a POLE is a vertical line. Orbits, pole dancing and trippy spins wind
 *   around it in the horizontal plane.
 *   a BAR is a horizontal line. Powerloops, mattys, split-S and immelmanns
 *   wind around it in the vertical plane: under, over, and under again.
 *
 * So an obstacle is not a shape, it is an AXIS with a reach. That reduces
 * every one of those tricks to one measurement, the winding number of the
 * craft's position about a line, which is the exact translational twin of
 * the rotation counting trickdetect.js already does. The two halves of the
 * recogniser end up the same shape, which is the point.
 *
 * WHERE THEY COME FROM. Measured, not assumed. The freestyle city registers
 * 17,643 colliders and every one of them is a BOX: 16,978 tagged 'wall' and
 * 665 tagged 'obstacle', with nothing tagged pole, tree, boom or gate. The
 * collider kinds are about how a hit FEELS, not about what the thing is, so
 * they say nothing useful here and the classification has to come from
 * geometry. Of those 17,643 boxes, 1,587 are pole shaped and 311 are bar
 * shaped by the rules below, which is a town's worth of lamp posts, sign
 * posts, railings and fence rails, and it is plenty.
 *
 * FRAME. This file works in THREE.JS WORLD SPACE, y up, metres. It has to:
 * the colliders it reads are the world's own geometry and they live in that
 * frame. It performs no conversion of its own, so CLAUDE.md's rule that the
 * frames meet exactly once in src/render/frame.js still holds. The rotation
 * half of the recogniser works in the plant's body frame and the two never
 * meet in a calculation: one counts turns of attitude, the other counts
 * turns of position, and neither is expressed in the other's axes.
 *
 * NO TRIGONOMETRY, same rule as trickdetect.js. Winding is accumulated as
 * cross over product of magnitudes, which is sin of the step angle, and at
 * 1 kHz the step angle is small enough that the difference does not reach
 * the fourth decimal place of a turn.

 */
/*
 * A POLE'S REACH IS NOT A BAR'S, and it was, which is why an orbit of the
 * training park's own mast stopped registering as soon as a pilot flew the
 * outer ring.
 *
 * Fourteen metres was measured for a BAR, from a powerloop: "a powerloop
 * flown on the real aircraft at a 12 m/s entry traces a loop about twelve
 * metres across". An ORBIT is a much bigger figure than a powerloop, and the
 * park says so on the ground: the mast "carries three painted rings at 6, 10
 * and 14 m" precisely so a pilot can see the radius they are flying. Twelve
 * metres of reach cannot cover a fourteen metre ring, and it is worse than
 * that, because the mast is four legs standing 1.5 m off the centre those
 * rings are drawn around, so the distance from a leg runs from 11.9 to 16.1
 * m on a 14 m orbit and the engagement flickers.
 *
 * Measured on the real aircraft, two tracked laps of the mast:
 *
 *    6 m   Orbit x2      10 m   Orbit x2      12 m   Orbit x2
 *   14 m   Orbit x2      16 m   NOTHING       18 m   NOTHING
 *
 * So a pilot flying the ring the park paints for them was on the edge of the
 * cliff, and one flying a little wider than the paint fell off it. Eighteen
 * covers the outer ring from any leg with room for a pilot who flies wide,
 * and it costs nothing in false positives: what refuses a fly past is the
 * WINDING TOTALS, which this file and trickdetect.js have both said from
 * their first versions, and the reach only decides whether the winding is
 * counted at all. scripts/orbit-check.js flies the negatives.
