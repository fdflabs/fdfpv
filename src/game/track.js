 * track.js: the course, as published dimensions and nothing else.
 *
 * MultiGP publishes its obstacle dimensions in feet and its Universal Time
 * Trial layouts as dimensioned diagrams. This file is the one place those
 * numbers live. Every figure below is either quoted from a MultiGP page or
 * measured from a MultiGP diagram at a stated scale, and the provenance of
 * each one is in .loop/evidence/r10/utt3-layout.md. Nothing here is
 * estimated from a photograph and nothing here is invented, because the
 * whole scale of the world is measured against the gate: a 250 mm quad
 * flying through a 3.8 m hole looks like a toy in a stadium, which is what
 * this project used to look like.

 * The guide PDFs are deliberately not vendored. They are MultiGP artwork

 * Units: feet appear only in FT and in the comments quoting the source.
 * Everything this module exports is metres, per CLAUDE.md. This module is
 * pure data and pure functions: no Three.js, no renderer, no simulator
 * state, so it can be read by the scene builder, by the race logic and by a

/*
 * How much larger than published every obstacle is BUILT, as a pure number.
 *
 * THE PUBLISHED DIMENSIONS ABOVE DO NOT MOVE. They are quoted from MultiGP
 * and the whole value of this file is that they are quoted rather than
 * chosen; a 5x5 gate is 1.524 m because MultiGP says 5 ft, and editing that
 * number to taste would leave the file looking like a citation while being an
 * opinion. So the departure is a separate, named, single number, and every
 * consumer reads the published value through it.
 *
 * The owner asked for it twice and then exactly: "the gates need to be
 * bigger", and then "the gates need to be 15 percent larger in the track".
 * That is a deliberate playability choice against the real rulebook, made
 * with the rulebook still on the page, and it is recorded as one because a
 * future round is going to ask why a gate here is not 5 ft.
 *
 * This is the only departure from real dimensions ON THE FIELD. A RaceGOW
 * room has MICRO_SCALE below, which is a different kind of thing: it scales
 * the aircraft with the world, so it is a change of units and not a bigger
 * hole, and the paragraph under it says why. The gate-widths-to-the-quad
 * ratio this constant is judged on is exactly what MICRO_SCALE preserves.
 * WORLD_SCALE in src/render/frame.js used to stack a second one on top, and
 * the pair of them put a 1.7526 m opening against a 0.2776 m craft, 6.31
 * gate widths to the quad where MultiGP against a real 5 inch is 4.39. That
 * scale is back to 1, so the ratio is 1.7526 against 0.347, which is 5.05
 * gate widths: the 15 percent above, and nothing else.
 *
 * Note what this constant does NOT do. It makes a gate bigger in metres, and
 * a bigger gate seen from proportionally further away looks identical, so it
 * is not the lever that decides whether a gate reads as small on screen.
 * That is the camera's field of view, and src/render/lens.js carries the
 * derivation.
 *
 * Everything with a length scales, so an obstacle grows as one object: the
 * opening, the sill a tower stands its opening on, the hurdle bar, the flag
 * offset and the frame tube itself. A gate with a 15 percent bigger hole and
 * the same pipe would read as a different product.
 */
export const GATE_SCALE = 1.15;

/*
 * AND IT IS THE SIXTY METRE FIELD'S NUMBER, so a RaceGOW room does not get
 * it. The paragraph above is the whole argument for why: the owner asked for
 * a bigger gate against MultiGP's rulebook, and the ratio it was judged on
 * was gate widths to the aircraft, 1.7526 m of opening against a 0.347 m
 * five inch, which is 5.05.
 *
 * A RaceGOW gate is 0.7112 m and a 65 mm whoop is 0.096 m across, which is
 * already 7.41 gate widths, half again as generous as the field the 15
 * percent was asked for. Applying it anyway makes 8.52, and it costs three
 * things that matter more than a hole nobody was struggling to hit.
 *
 * It stops being RaceGOW. The rules are published in inches and the whole
 * point of the class is that a track flown here is the track built at home:
 * a 28 inch gate flown as 32.2 is a different gate.
 *
 * It desynchronises the builder from the world. Every RaceGOW warning in
 * src/trackbuilder/warnings.js is computed on the document's own metres, so
 * an author who clears rule 3's spacing and fits RaceGOW's 1.42 by 2.13 m
 * envelope on the plan flies a track that does neither.
 *
 * And the room does not scale with it. The 60 by 40 field has no walls, so
 * 15 percent of gate costs nothing there; a 5 by 6 m room has four, and a
 * gate grown 15 percent inside a room that did not grow is a smaller room.
 */
/*
 * THE MICRO WORLD IS BUILT LIFE SIZE TIMES THIS, AND THE AIRCRAFT FLYING IT
 * IS A FIVE INCH.
 *
 * The argument, because it reads like a cheat and is not one.
 *
 * A whoop is not a small five inch. It has three times the angular
 * acceleration and a fifth of the speed, and the plant modelled that
 * honestly for months. The owner flew it and the answer was the same every
 * time: it does not feel like flying. A real whoop, in a real room, flies
 * MOSTLY LIKE A FIVE INCH WITH SLIGHTLY LESS MOMENTUM, because a pilot flies
 * to what the picture does, and the picture is the same picture. The
 * difference the plant was reproducing is real and is not the thing the
 * pilot feels.
 *
 * So the whoop flies the five inch's plant, and the room it flies in is
 * built big enough for a five inch. That is this number.
 *
 * IT IS A CHANGE OF UNITS AND NOTHING ELSE, which is the part worth being
 * precise about. Scale a world and the craft in it by the same factor and
 * every rendered frame is IDENTICAL: the camera sits at the craft's origin,
 * so what reaches the screen is the world measured in craft widths, and that
 * ratio is what this preserves. A pilot cannot see this constant. What they
 * can feel is everything it is divided against: the five inch's inertia, its
 * thrust to weight, its rate damping, its drag.
 *
 * THE VALUE IS DERIVED, NOT CHOSEN. It is the ratio of the two aircraft's
 * sweep radii, arm plus hull, which is the same measure src/game/collide.js
 * uses for both and the same one the GATE_SCALE argument above is written
 * in. 0.1735 m against 0.0506 m is 3.4289.
 *
 * That is exactly the factor that leaves every clearance on the track the
 * number of craft widths it is today. A 0.7112 m RaceGOW gate against a
 * 0.1012 m whoop is 7.03 gate widths; built at this scale it is a 2.4387 m
 * opening against a 0.347 m five inch, which is 7.03. The room, the run off,
 * the ceiling and the pole gaps all carry over the same way, so the tracks
 * that were designed against the old machine still read correctly.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS is that the room is secretly a hangar: 34.3 by 41.1 m with a
 * 13.7 m ceiling. Nothing on screen says so, because the shed, the gates and
 * the aircraft are all built through this, and gravity is the only thing in
 * the simulation that does not scale. That is the whole of the fiction, and
 * it is spent buying the five inch's flight model for a machine that looks
 * like a whoop.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NOT TOUCH is the document. src/trackbuilder is RaceGOW's own
 * inches, the warnings, the envelope and rule 3's spacing are computed on
 * them, and a published track has to mean the same thing to a pilot building
 * it out of PVC at home. The scale is applied where a document becomes a
 * FLOWN COURSE, in src/game/trackdoc.js, and nowhere upstream of that.
