/*
 * tricks.js: the freestyle trick catalogue and the score model, as published
 * numbers and nothing else.
 *
 * Every figure in this file is transcribed from one spreadsheet: The Whoop
 * Pilots' freestyle scoring calculator, "Tyrantt_Pro_Whooper.xlsx", supplied
 * by the owner on 2026-08-30. It is the scoring sheet a real freestyle
 * competition runs on: a judge picks each trick off a list, marks how it was
 * flown, and the sheet applies the penalties. Nothing here is invented and
 * nothing here is tuned to feel good. When a number in this file looks wrong,
 * the sheet is the argument, not this file.
 *
 * The extracted workbook lives at
 *   tests/fixtures/freestyle-scoring/twp-calculator.json
 * and `npm run score:selftest` asserts this file still agrees with it, name
 * for name and point for point. The workbook itself is not vendored: it is 1.4 MB
 * of XLSX carrying three embedded images, and the project needs the numbers
 * rather than the file. That is the same rule src/game/track.js applies to
 * the MultiGP course PDFs.
 *
 * WHICH SHEET. The workbook scores indoor and outdoor separately, and the
 * two disagree: an indoor Flip is 75 points where an outdoor Flip is 50,
 * because indoor tricks are named against a specific obstacle class and
 * outdoor tricks are not. Freestyle city is a town, so this file carries the
 * OUTDOOR list, from the sheet "Trick List - Outdoor". The indoor sheet's
 * obstacle classes (Single Gate, Cube, Under/Over, Triple Gate Stack, Dive
 * Gate, Wall Taps) are in the evidence JSON if a hall is ever built.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, and it is deliberate. The workbook also carries "Trick
 * of the Week", a KWAD letter bonus and a map-of-the-week multiplier. Those
 * are the administration of a weekly online competition, not a property of
 * flying, and a simulator that awarded a doubling for whichever trick a
 * coordinator posted on a Monday would be scoring the calendar. The tables
 * are preserved in the evidence JSON. They are the obvious shape for a daily
 * challenge later, which is the only reason to say what they were.
 *
 * Units: points are points, dimensionless. Angles anywhere near this file
 * are turns, not degrees and not radians, because the sheet's own language
 * is "180 degrees" and "360 degrees" and a turn is the honest unit for a
 * thing that is counted rather than measured.
