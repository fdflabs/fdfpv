/*
 * race.js: the race. Gate sequencing, lap timing, best lap, and gate
 * frame contact.
 *
 * Scoring aperture is the glowing RING, not the outer frame: the ring is
 * what a pilot aims at. Detection is a swept box in the gate's local
 * frame, the opening extruded a short way along the direction of travel,
 * so a line through the hole at an angle still counts and a dive gate
 * scores against the same plane the mesh stands in.
 *
 * Lap times run on the SIMULATION clock, interpolated to the crossing
 * point, not on the wall clock: a frame hitch freezes the quad, and a
 * scoreboard that keeps counting while the physics stands still would
 * punish slow machines. The whole project is built on deterministic
 * physics; the timing is only honest if it reads the same clock.
 *
 * Touching a gate frame voids the lap rather than destroying the craft:
 * no real race kills you for a gate tap, the penalty is your lap.
 *
 * All of this runs in Three.js world space (y up), downstream of the
 * physics. Nothing here feeds back into the simulation.

 * The scoring aperture is the aperture the pilot can SEE, taken from the

 *
 * This file used to carry its own copy of the gate's geometry: GATE_HALF_W
 * 3.0, GATE_H 5.0, RING_R 1.9, CRAFT_R 0.25. Three of those four disagreed
 * with what scene.js drew, and the scoring test subtracted the craft radius
 * from the torus CENTRELINE while ignoring the tube, so a craft could be
 * credited with a clean pass while its body passed through the ring. A gate
 * that scores differently from how it looks is a gate the pilot cannot learn.
 *
 * Frame contact used to live here too and it voided the lap. It does not any
 * more: the frame is solid, collision is src/game/collide.js, and hitting
 * one is a crash. The owner's words were that the gates need to be solid.
 *
 * The scoring hole is the visible opening, minus a fingernail of margin.
 * Folding the craft radius in on top of that was a second shrink: a 1.75 m
 * gate offered 1.40 m, and a clean line near the stile did not count.
 * Collision already owns a clip of the tube.

     * on the way to somewhere else, and WCMRC Round 5 flies one gate five
     * times in a lap. On a course like that an incidental crossing is a
     * feature of the geometry rather than a shortcut, and voiding for it
     * punishes the pilot for the layout. Nothing is gained by cutting a gate
     * either: the sequence still has to be flown in order, so an out of
     * sequence pass advances nothing and only costs the time it took.
