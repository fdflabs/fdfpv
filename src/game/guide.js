/*
 * guide.js: the marks on the ground that say where to fly.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT THE BUILDER'S HERMITE. path.js draws a smooth cubic
 * through every knot with tangents taken off gate normals. That is the
 * right line for the plan view and for the curvature warning, because it
 * is forced through every opening square-on. It is the wrong line to
 * paint on the grass. A racer does not square up to every gate and then
 * balloon out to the next one; they pull a taut string around the flags
 * and go through the gates on the way. Painting the Hermite is how you
 * end up with a kart-track stripe that misses the side of a flag a
 * pilot would actually take.
 *
 * WHAT A RACER FLIES, as geometry:
 *
 *   a flag or a cone is a peg of radius `clearance`. The line is the
 *   taut string around that peg, on the pass side the sequence named;
 *   a gate is a point the string has to hit. The line goes through the
 *   opening's centre and does not try to wrap it;
 *   stacked wraps (split-S, spiral) are already offset knots, so they
 *   are points too. The ground mark is the plan of that wrap, which is
 *   the bit that says "go around, then back through".
 *
 * The paint is sparse on purpose. A dashed centreline, and arrows only
 * where the pilot has a height decision: two arrows side by side means
 * go up, one arrow means stay low. A comma on the fly side of an
 * isolated flag shows the pass. Close flags in a slalom get the dashes
 * only; wrapping every pole with a chevron is how the marks stacked.
 * A continuous stripe would read as a road.
 *
 * Scene frame, Y up, metres. This file does not import the builder and
 * it does not import Three.js: the field map must not pay for a track
 * document to draw its own figure eight, and the builder self test must
 * be able to check the line in Node. That includes racegow.js, so every
 * RaceGOW figure quoted below is written out as a literal with its source
 * named rather than imported.
 *
 * TWO TRACK CLASSES. Every length in GUIDE is metres of paint, and paint
 * is sized against the aircraft that flies over it and the track it is
 * drawn on. 'full' is the sixty metre field: a 1.524 m MultiGP gate, a
 * 5 inch quad that sweeps 0.1735 m to a blade tip, a lap of about 570 m.
 * 'micro' is a RaceGOW room: a 0.711 m gate out of 26.7 mm PVC, a 65 mm
 * whoop that sweeps 0.048 m, a lap of about 7 m inside a 1.42 by 2.13 m
 * envelope, in a 5 by 6 m room with a 2.4 m ceiling. The class comes in as
 * an argument, from src/game/trackdoc.js and from the builder's two views,
 * and guideFor turns it into one paint table. Nothing in this file reads a
 * global to find out which track it is drawing.

   * THE MICRO SET, and it exists because every number above was chosen
   * against a 1.524 m gate, a 5 inch quad 0.347 m across and a lap of about
   * 570 m. A RaceGOW room is none of those things. Every figure quoted in
   * this block is from src/trackbuilder/racegow.js, which cites where
   * RaceGOW published it.
   *
   * They are in one block rather than scattered through the entries above,
   * so a reader can see the whole of what changes with the class and so
   * guideFor is one lookup rather than thirty. Same shape as TUNING.micro
   * in src/trackbuilder/elements.js, deliberately.
   *
   * TWO KINDS OF LENGTH SCALE DIFFERENTLY HERE, and saying it once beats
   * saying it thirty times.
   *
   * A length ACROSS the line is read through the camera. A micro pilot flies
   * at a ground gate's opening centre, 0.356 m, where a full sized one flies
   * at 0.762 m, so a mark a little under half as wide subtends the same
   * angle and the paint looks the same in the goggles.
   *
   * A length ALONG the line cannot use that ratio, because the lap did not
   * scale with the gates. 570 m became 7 m, a factor of eighty, while the
   * gate only halved: a RaceGOW track is packed, six or seven elements
   * inside 1.42 by 2.13 m, so a leg between two gates is about a metre.
   * Every along the line number below is derived from that line instead:
   * from RaceGOW's 0.762 m nominal gate spacing, from the one metre leg,
   * and from the 7 m lap.
   *
   * `wrapSpan` is deliberately absent and must stay absent. 120 degrees of
   * a circle is 120 degrees of a circle whatever the circle is.
