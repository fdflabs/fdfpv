/*
 * banners.js: the printed vinyl a race course is dressed in.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Every gate on a drone racing course wears printed banner
 * sleeves, and every course is lined with printed teardrop flags. The gates
 * and walls are white vinyl, with the event's mark sitting on the header
 * board, and the flags keep the navy, red and chequer language that says
 * racing from further away than a wordmark can be read. This module paints
 * that onto canvases. It knows nothing about Three.js, nothing about the
 * physics, and nothing about the track document.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SHARED AND WHY IT LIVES HERE. Two consumers need identical
 * artwork: src/render/scene.js dresses the world with it, and
 * src/trackbuilder/view3d.js dresses the AUTHOR'S PREVIEW with it, so that
 * what somebody builds looks like what they fly. The builder is not allowed
 * to import the simulator (see src/trackbuilder/schema.md), so the artwork
 * cannot live in src/render. It is not the game and it is not the builder: it
 * is the art both of them draw from, so it is its own directory.
 *
 * NO TRADEMARKS. The reference for this look is a MultiGP course, and what is
 * reproduced is the FORM: a white header board, sleeve banners down the
 * uprights, a chequered flag band as a border, teardrop flags with a navy or
 * red sweep. The mark on the board is whatever the author uploads, and with
 * nothing uploaded it is a chequered flag device this file draws, not
 * anybody's logo.
 *
 * THE CALLER OWNS THE CANVAS. Each painter takes a 2D context and its size
 * and paints the whole of it. The caller decides how big, wraps it in
 * whatever texture object it uses, and repaints when the logo finishes
 * decoding. That is what lets one module serve two renderers.

 * THE FEATHER SAIL'S PRINT.
 *
 * The canvas maps straight onto the sail's own parameters: u across, from the
 * seam on the mast at 0 to the free edge at 1, and v up the mast. So the
 * LEFT of this canvas is the leading edge, and the canvas's TOP is the head,
 * because a CanvasTexture flips v.
 *
 * WHAT THE SHAPE CHANGED. The panel this lands on is now a tall narrow
 * rectangle with its mast side corner swept away, about one across to three
 * and a half up where the teardrop was one to two and three quarters, so
 * every band here is re-proportioned rather than moved. Two things are new
 * and both are consequences of the outline rather than taste:
 *
 *   THE HEAD IS A SOLID BLOCK OF THE ACCENT. Above FLAG.bend the rows fan
 *   into the corner the mast's sweep cuts, so anything with structure in it,
 *   a chequer or a mark, would visibly bend there. One colour cannot. It is
 *   also what the flag reads as from further away than any print: a coloured
 *   head over a pale body.
 *
 *   THE LEADING BAND IS NARROWER, 0.26 of the width against 0.30 to 0.40.
 *   On a panel this narrow the old sweep left the mark a strip too thin to
 *   read at commit range, and the mark is what a sponsor bought.
 *
 * `accent` swaps the band and the head between navy and red so a run of
 * flags down a course alternates without needing two designs.
 *
 * `mirrorMark` flips the MARK inside its box and leaves the rest of the
 * design where it is. On its own that would be vandalism; it exists for the
 * reverse of the cloth, and paintFlagSailPair below is the only caller.

/*
 * BOTH FACES OF ONE SAIL, SIDE BY SIDE ON ONE SHEET.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. A sail is one piece of cloth, so it was drawn as one sheet
 * of triangles with one set of texture coordinates, and the reverse faces
 * shared them. Every mark on every flag on the course therefore read in a
 * mirror from behind, which is the one thing a sponsor's mark must never do.
 * The gate boards never had this: they are two planes back to back, the
 * reverse turned a half turn about the upright, which is what a real printed
 * banner is and what makes it read the right way round from either side.
 *
 * WHY THE CLOTH CANNOT JUST DO THAT. A board's design is symmetric enough to
 * turn round: the mark sits in the middle and both ends are left clear. A
 * feather flag's is not. The accent band is on the LEADING edge, and the
 * leading edge is the mast, which is a physical object in the same place for
 * a viewer on either side. Turn the print round and the band ends up on the
 * free edge from behind, which no printed flag has ever looked like. What a
 * double sided flag actually carries is the same layout on both faces with
 * the ink reversed, so the band stays on the mast and the mark still reads.
 *
 * SO THE SHEET IS TWICE AS WIDE and holds the design twice: the front in the
 * left half, and in the right half the same design mirrored, with the mark
 * mirrored a second time so it comes back the right way round. The reverse
 * faces read the right half BACKWARDS, u running from 1 at the mast to 0.5
 * at the free edge, which is what puts the band back on the mast.
 *
 * ONE MATERIAL, ONE DRAW CALL, and that is why it is one sheet rather than
 * two textures. The world bakes seventy two flags into merged meshes keyed
 * by material, and a mesh with two materials cannot be merged that way at
 * all. The seam is at the FREE edge of both halves, so the two sides of it
 * carry near enough the same texels and no mip level can show a join.

/*
 * THE FLAG ITSELF: a feather flag, not a teardrop.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED AND WHY. What stood on the course was a teardrop: narrow at
 * the foot, widest through the middle, drawn to a point at the head, on a
 * straight mast. That is a real product and it is not the one a race course
 * is lined with. The reference the owner supplied is a FEATHER flag, and the
 * difference is structural rather than decorative:
 *
 *   THE MAST BENDS. The bottom four fifths is a straight pole and the top
 *   fifth is a fibreglass whip that sweeps forward through about a hundred
 *   degrees. That sweep is the whole silhouette. A straight mast cannot make
 *   this shape whatever outline you cut the cloth to.
 *
 *   THE SAIL IS A TALL NARROW PANEL, not a leaf. Its trailing edge is a
 *   straight vertical line hanging from the mast's TIP, its foot is a
 *   horizontal hem, and its leading edge is the mast, so the top corner on
 *   the mast side is swept away by the bend. Width is about 0.23 of the
 *   flag's height where the teardrop's widest point was 0.30, and it is that
 *   width for four fifths of its length instead of at one station.
 *
 *   THE MAST'S TIP IS NOT ITS HIGHEST POINT. The arc turns past horizontal,
 *   so it apexes and comes back down a little. The apex is what a pilot's
 *   eye and the collider both have to treat as the top, which is why the
 *   numbers below put the APEX at exactly the flag's stated height.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE. Four consumers have to agree about this shape: the
 * world's mast mesh, the world's sail mesh, the builder preview's two, and
 * the print, whose canvas has to be the panel's own aspect or a chequer
 * comes out of square. This module is already the one both renderers draw
 * from, and this is geometry rather than artwork only in the sense that the
 * outline and the print are the same decision. It is plain numbers: no
