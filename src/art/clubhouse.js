/*
 * clubhouse.js: the club's pavilion, and the ground it stands on.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. A country sports pavilion of the kind every flying club in
 * Australia meets at: one long low building on a levelled terrace beside the
 * oval, a folded pale roof over it, a solar array on the sunny plane, and a
 * verandah running the whole field side. The verandah is the point. That is
 * where the pit tables go and where the pilots stand, so it is modelled OPEN,
 * on posts, with the tables on it, rather than as the closed box that
 * photogrammetry makes of a roof with people under it.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE. src/render/scene.js dresses BOTH race maps, the built in
 * circuit and a course somebody drew, and both get the clubhouse: a race field
 * is a club's field. Putting the mesh in src/art keeps it beside the start
 * blocks and the printed banners, which is the other art the world and the
 * track builder both draw from, and it keeps a 600 line building out of a
 * file that is already the world.
 *
 * LOCAL FRAME, Y up, matching Three.js. +X runs along the building, +Z points
 * AT THE FIELD, and the origin is the middle of the front wall at the level of
 * the mown ground. So the building is at negative Z, the verandah, the steps
 * and the apron are at positive Z, and a caller places the whole complex by
 * putting the origin on the field's edge and yawing it to face in.
 *
 * ONE MESH, ONE MATERIAL, VERTEX COLOURS. Not one material per surface. The
 * scenery merger in scene.js buckets by material, so a building with a roof
 * material, a wall material, a brick material and a glass material is four
 * more merged meshes and eight more draw calls, because each bucket is
 * submitted again in the outline prepass. Every colour here is a vertex
 * colour on a single cel material instead, so the whole pavilion, its
 * terrace, its car park and its pit tables cost ONE bucket. The palette is
 * still authored per surface; it just travels in the geometry.
 *
 * FLAT SHADED ON PURPOSE. Every face carries its own normal, so each roof
 * plane, each wall and each fascia reads as one flat band under the cel ramp.
 * That is what the style wants from a building: a drawn shape with a crisp
 * edge, not a softly rounded mass.
 *
 * THREE.JS IS PASSED IN, the same rule startblock.js follows, so this file
 * has no imports at all and the track builder could draw the same pavilion
 * without pulling the simulator in behind it.

/*
 * THE PALETTE, SOLVED AGAINST MEASURED VALUES RATHER THAN PICKED.
 *
 * The world's value structure, which scene.js states at the top: the sky is
 * the brightest thing, the ground a clear step below it, objects a step below
 * that. Sampled off a capture of this map at 1600 by 900, the anchors are
 *
 *   sky                       0.525
 *   mountain ring ladder      0.250, 0.310, 0.370, 0.430
 *   lit meadow                0.094
 *
 * The first palette authored the roof at 0xcfc9b8, on the reasoning that a
 * real Colorbond roof is nearly white and that authoring white here would
 * make the pavilion the brightest thing in the frame. That reasoning was
 * wrong and the capture said so: the roof rendered at 0.266, which is the
 * nearest mountain ring's 0.263 to within a thousandth. A building forty
 * metres away was the same value as a range at five hundred and sixty, so
 * aerial perspective ran backwards across it and the pavilion read as one
 * dark mass welded to the horizon.
 *
 * The reason the caution was wrong is also measured. A band 3 (sunlit)
 * surface renders at about 0.45 of its authored linear luminance once the
 * ramp, the light colour and the tone map have had it, so pure white comes
 * out near 0.48 and lands UNDER the sky rather than over it. There was never
 * a white roof to be afraid of.
 *
 * So the roof is authored bright, to sit above every ring in the ladder and
 * below the sky, which is exactly the slot a white roof belongs in. The
 * verandah roof and its fascia stay near black: they are the darkest things
 * on the building and they are what carries its silhouette, and the
 * reference's own strongest feature is that dark band under a pale roof.
 *
 * The verandah's INSIDE is a separate problem with a separate answer. The sun
 * here sits at 30 degrees and the verandah is 4.55 m deep, so the wall behind
 * it is in cast shadow at every hour this world has: traced, a ray over the
 * fascia reaches the wall 0.52 m BELOW the deck. Nothing about the geometry
 * changes that and nothing should, because that is what a verandah is. What
 * can change is the albedo, so the soffit is a pale painted lining rather
 * than the dark of the sheeting above it, which is both what these buildings
 * really are and the only lever that lifts a shadowed recess off the floor.

 * NOTHING IS PUNCHED, and this function is here to say so in the one place

 * window is a solid pane of CLUB.glass, each door is two leaves and a
 * meeting stile, and the shutter is a shutter. So the fix for an invisible
 * wall in clear air shipped ten sheets of glass a quad flew straight
 * through, which is the same defect pointing the other way and the one
 * this file's rule forbids: a gap you see is a gap you fly.
 *
 * The reported bug was never the rooms. It was that the old mass ran from
 * the back wall to 0.45 m PAST the front face, so the strip of verandah in
 * front of the glass, which is drawn as clear air and is the line a pilot
 * takes through the pits, was solid. Thin walls fix that, and they fix it
 * whether or not anything is punched. So the building is shut, its walls
 * hug what is drawn, and its shell has a lid.
 *
 * A pavilion a quad can fly through would be a good thing to have, and
 * this is where its openings would go. It needs the elevation drawn open
 * and the rooms given inward faces, which is art rather than a bug fix:
 * DoubleSide on the existing single boxes puts every dado and sill into z
 * fighting with the wall it is painted on, measured on this map. Worth
