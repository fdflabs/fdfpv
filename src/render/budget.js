/*
 * budget.js: measure the hardware contract, rather than assert it.
 *
 * The minimum spec for this project is a mid range laptop from five years
 * ago at 1920 by 1080 and 60 frames per second. Absolute frame rate is not
 * measurable in a software rasterised container, so the contract is a set
 * of proxies that are: draw calls, triangles, full resolution post passes,
 * texture taps per output pixel, render target bytes, load time, the worst
 * synchronous block, shadow maps, and resident vertex attribute bytes.
 *
 * Everything here reads the live objects. Nothing is a constant copied out
 * of a comment. The pass count and the tap count in particular come from
 * instrumenting one real frame and reading the fragment shader source that
 * was actually bound, because a pass list read from a source file does not
 * know which passes are enabled or what resolution they ran at.
 *
 * Called on demand from the capture harness through window.__budget. It is
 * never called from the frame loop.
