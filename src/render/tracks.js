/*
 * tracks.js: the record crates. Recorded tracks as data, no audio code.
 *
 * The bed used to be a generated drum and bass and lofi performer. That
 * crate is gone. These are the files in assets/music, played by
 * src/render/music.js through one MediaElementSource on the mix bus.
 *
 * There are TWO crates and they are not interchangeable. TRACKS is the
 * flight crate, what plays while the pilot is flying, and it is the crate
 * the Music track setting picks from. MENU_TRACKS is the menu bed, what
 * plays on every screen that is not a flight, quieter, chosen at random
 * each time the menus come back. A menu is a place where somebody is
 * reading rows and deciding something, and twelve tracks written to be
 * flown to are the wrong thing to read over.
 *
 * Both crates live in the same assets/music directory and share one id
 * namespace, checked below, because they share one URL space and one
 * cache rule in render.yaml.
 *
 * There is no filename column any more. Every track is
 * assets/music/<id>.webm and assets/music/<id>.mp3, written by
 * scripts/music.js from the id below, which is why the id is the slug of
 * the title. That is one fact instead of two that could disagree, and it
 * takes the percent encoding out of the URL: the crate used to carry
 * names like 'Neon Gate take 2.mp3' and 'Pace Shift Skyline (1).mp3',
 * and a space and a bracket in a media URL is a thing that works
 * everywhere until it does not.
 *
 * Two formats because they are not the same price. Opus in a WebM
 * averages 2.6 MB a track across this crate, the mp3 fallback 3.1 MB, the
 * masters they came from 4.2 to 5.9 MB. src/render/music.js picks with
 * canPlayType and falls back on a load error. See scripts/music.js for
 * the encode.

/*
 * THE ONE THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT THIS FILE.
 *
 * render.yaml serves /assets/music/* immutable for a year, because a
 * three minute track that has to be revalidated on every visit is a round
 * trip nobody is paid for. The filenames below never change, so the only
 * thing that can tell a browser the audio did is this number. RE-ENCODE
 * THE CRATE, BUMP THIS. A visitor who does not is holding last year's
 * mix and there is no way for them to find out.
 *
 * Adding a record or dropping one is NOT that, and does not want a bump.
 * A new id is a URL nobody has cached and a dropped id is a URL nothing
 * asks for any more, so neither can go stale. Bumping over either would
 * re-fetch every track that did not change, which on this crate is forty
 * megabytes charged to a returning visitor for nothing. The bump is for
 * bytes moving under a filename that stayed put.
