/*
 * whoopcraft.js: the 65 mm ducted whoop's model, and nothing else.
 *
 * Its own file rather than a branch inside herocraft.js because the two
 * aircraft do not share a silhouette. A 5 inch is four arms and four open
 * discs: what you see is the X. A whoop is a SOLID, a moulded tub with four
 * holes in it, and the ducts are the outermost thing on it in every
 * direction, which is why it survives hitting a wall and why it flies badly
 * sideways. Trying to draw both from one parameterised builder would have
 * meant a builder with two of everything and a boolean, and the file would
 * have belonged to neither machine.
 *
 * The subject is a 65 mm whoop, which is the aircraft
 * src/native/plant.c flies as SIM_AIRFRAME_WHOOP65 and the one a RaceGOW
 * field mostly turns up on. Real dimensions throughout:
 *
 *   wheelbase       65 mm motor to motor across the diagonal
 *   duct bore       33 mm, a 31 mm Gemfan 1207 three blade with a 1 mm gap
 *   duct           a short shroud with a raised bumper hoop over the lip
 *   stack          a Matrix 1S 5IN1 II with a C03 in a cage at the front
 *   pack            a 1S 280 mAh pack on a BT2.0 pigtail, under the belly
 *   all up          23.4 g
 *
 * IT IS SOLD BARE AND IT IS DRAWN BARE. An earlier pass put a sakura dome
 * over the electronics, which is a capped machine's shape and not this one, and on
 * a 65 mm aircraft it was a third of the machine in one flat colour: at any
 * distance the whoop read as a pink blob. A whoop has no canopy at all.
 * The board is the top of the aircraft, you look straight down at the green,
 * the chips and the motor leads, and the only tall thing on it is the camera.
 *
 * So the project's palette lands differently here from herocraft.js, on
 * purpose: the frame is the light cool grey the moulding really is, the stack
 * is the green every flight controller is, and sakura is one trim line on the
 * camera cage with mint on the lamps. A pilot who switched aircraft is
 * looking at the same furniture, on the machine that owns it.
 *
 * The contract with the shell is herocraft.js's, field for field: group,
 * discs, blades, leds, cameraMount, stator, propSpin. src/render/shell.js
 * and src/main.js do not learn that there are two aircraft.
