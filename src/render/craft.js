/*
 * craft.js: the quad's model, and nothing else.
 *
 * It lives on its own because it is SESSION LIVED and the maps are not. The
 * shell builds one craft at boot and re-parents it into whichever map's scene
 * is active, so swapping the race field for the freestyle city does not
 * rebuild the airframe, does not recompile its four cel materials, and cannot
 * leave the shell holding a craft that belongs to a disposed scene.
 *
 * Betaflight motor order is RR FR RL FL with the front at -z, and the numbers
 * here are a real 5 inch machine: a 0.155 m body front to back, motors at
 * 0.0778 m on each axis which is a 0.220 m motor to motor diagonal, and
 * 0.0635 m prop discs which is half of five inches. src/game/collide.js
 * derives CRAFT_R from the same measurements and tests/lib/checks.js asserts
 * the two agree, because this project has shipped a scale error before.
