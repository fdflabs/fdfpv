/*
 * quality.js: named graphics presets, and the only place they are defined.
 *
 * WHY THREE NAMES AND NOT A WALL OF SLIDERS. This is a flight sim with a
 * radio-navigable menu, not a PC configurator. Forza, GT and every recent
 * console racer treat Low / Medium / High as the player-facing control and
 * hide the knobs behind them. One row, three values, a note that says what
 * the current one is for. Changing it rebuilds the world, because the
 * expensive levers (city foliage, shadow proxies) are bake time, not
 * frame time. Grass blades are not a lever: they are not drawn.
 *
 * WHAT THE ORIGINAL SPEC GOT WRONG, AND WHAT THIS FILE FIXES.
 *
 *   "None should require a GPU."
 *   WebGL always talks to a GPU, or to a software rasteriser pretending to
 *   be one (SwiftShader, llvmpipe). The real requirement is: no preset
 *   needs a DISCRETE GPU, WebGPU, compute shaders, mesh shaders or ray
 *   tracing. failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat stays false, so a machine with
 *   only a software renderer still boots. High is sized for a 2021-era
 *   PC or a strong laptop iGPU (RTX 3060 class, Intel Xe, M1), Medium for
 *   a 2020-era laptop iGPU (UHD 620 / Iris Plus / MX350), Low for a Steam
 *   Deck APU at 800p. All three are WebGL.
 *
 *   "If a GPU is present then it is used."
 *   The session renderer asks for powerPreference high-performance, so a
 *   dual-GPU laptop uses the discrete chip rather than the battery iGPU.
 *   Quality then scales resolution and effects, not which device draws.
 *   Orbit thumbnails and the settings-studio craft keep low-power: they
 *   are secondary contexts and must not steal the Deck's one GPU.
 *
 *   "Default to Medium."
 *   High IS the authored look. The field budget check (map-isolation)
 *   pins High's draw calls, triangles and target bytes. Defaulting to
 *   Medium would silently change the product and fail that check. First
 *   run on a Steam Deck / SteamOS user agent picks Low; everyone else
 *   gets High. The player can always change it. We never auto-switch
 *   Low / Medium / High mid session: a hitch in FPV is less honest
 *   than a menu the pilot opened on purpose. Internal resolution is the
 *   Render scale slider, which the pilot sets and which does not change
 *   the named preset. It is not automatic: the pacer that would have
 *   driven it needs a per map applyPace hook that no map implements,
 *   and pace.js says so at the top of the file.
 *
 *   "Low, a bit less grass."
 *   Blades are not drawn at any preset. The first 184000 world draws
 *   are still walked so the valley does not relocate. Density is not a
 *   quality lever.
 *
 * TARGETS, not promises. These are the machines the presets are BUILT
 * for, at 60 fps where the hardware can hold it, 40 fps on a Deck in its
 * 40 Hz mode. Fill rate is the enemy on handhelds; draw calls and
 * triangles are the enemy in the city.

/*
 * A NOTE ON THE NOTES, because they are read by a pilot deciding what to
 * pick and they were promising something the field does not do.
 *
 * They used to say "fewer plants", "thinned planting" and "full planting"
 * without saying where. Only the city has a planting lever, `foliageKeep`;
 * the field reads shadowMap and shadowHalf out of this table and nothing
 * else, and its trees, rocks and cliffs come off a fixed rng walk. Measured
 * at 1600 by 900, the field draws 949,309 triangles on High and 949,296 on
 * Medium, the difference being the bloom quads, with the same 134 meshes on
 * all three presets. So the notes now say "the town", which is true, rather
 * than implying a lever the race field has never had.

       * is exactly the "strong laptop iGPU" this preset names, rendered

       * composer targets. Scaling the measured 900p ledger, that is about
       * 237 MB of render targets against this project's own 120 MB budget,
       * and 3.6 times the fill of the 1080p frame the budget check pins.
       *
       * 2,073,600 is 1920 by 1080, and it is not a round number chosen for

       * ceiling was measured at, in the low spec loop that took P5 from
       * 291 MB to 109.8 (PROGRESS.md, "Low spec loop, round 2"). So the

       * than the screen the budget was measured on.

       * laptop, from 5.2 Mpx to 2.07, the 1440p monitor from 3.7, and the
