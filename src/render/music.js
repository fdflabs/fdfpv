/*
 * music.js: recorded tracks on the mix bus.
 *
 * The generated performer (oscillators, noise buffers, a sixteenth-note
 * scheduler, mini-notation sheets) is gone. This file plays the crates in
 * src/render/tracks.js through one HTMLAudioElement and one
 * MediaElementSource. That is four AudioNodes (source, level, swap, duck)
 * against the 64 node budget, and it is the only way a multi megabyte
 * track does not sit decoded in memory before the first note.
 *
 * TWO CRATES, ONE ELEMENT.
 *
 * TRACKS is what plays while the pilot is flying. MENU_TRACKS is what
 * plays on every other screen, quieter, rolled at random each time the
 * menus come back. The context word for those two states is 'flight' and
 * 'menu' and it arrives through setContext, from the one place in the
 * shell that knows which screen is up.
 *
 * They share ONE element on purpose. A second element and a second
 * MediaElementSource would be two more nodes and two more things to keep
 * paused, and the two beds are never wanted at once: the whole point is
 * that one of them stops when the other starts. What a single element
 * costs is a load at every context change, which is why the swap is
 * fenced by a fade and why the menus warm the flight track.
 *
 * WHAT A CONTEXT CHANGE DOES.
 *
 * setContext does not swap anything. It ramps the swap gain to zero over
 * SWAP_FALL_S and leaves a note; tick() does the swap once that ramp has
 * run and then ramps back up over SWAP_RISE_S. Setting src on a media
 * element is instant and the audio that comes back out of it is not, so a
 * swap done in the same call as the decision is a cut into silence into a
 * cold start. Done this way it is a fade out, a gap covered by the fade,
 * and a fade in.
 *
 * Every track's position is remembered by id and restored on the way
 * back. Without it a menu visit is thirty seconds, and a player who flies
 * eight races has heard the first thirty seconds of the menu bed eight
 * times and the rest of it never. That is the definition of obtrusive.
 *
 * THE THREE THINGS THIS FILE DOES ABOUT A SLOW CONNECTION.
 *
 * One, it asks for the cheap format. Every track is on disk twice, Opus
 * in a WebM at about 2.5 MB and mp3 at about 3.1 MB, from masters that
 * were 5.7 MB. canPlayType picks, and a WebM that will not decode demotes
 * the whole session to mp3 and reloads the same track, so a browser that
 * answers 'maybe' and then cannot open the file gets music rather than a
 * skip through twelve tracks to silence.
 *
 * Two, preload is 'none' and not 'auto'. attach() runs on the first
 * gesture, which is usually the same click that starts a flight, and with
 * 'auto' the element starts pulling a whole track down at that moment
 * whether or not the player has music on at all. Nothing is fetched now
 * until play() is called, and play() is only called when the bed is
 * wanted. With music off the cost is zero bytes rather than one track.
 *
 * Three, it warms one track out of spare bandwidth, never out of the
 * bandwidth the thing playing is using, and never at all under
 * Save-Data. In the menus the warm is the FLIGHT track, because the menus
 * are where a flight is about to be started and the element cannot start
 * buffering it before the swap; that warm waits until the menu bed is
 * WARM_MENU_AHEAD_S buffered ahead of itself, which is the connection
 * saying it has room. In flight the warm is the next record in the
 * rotation, inside the last WARM_LEAD_S seconds and only once the current
 * track is buffered to its own end.
