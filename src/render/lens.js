 * lens.js: the camera's field of view, and the argument for it.
 *
 * One file, no imports, because three things need this number and none of
 * them should have to depend on the others to get it: the shell builds the
 * camera, the settings screen offers the list, and the shared orbit clip is
 * shot on the same lens so a course does not look like a different course in
 * the clip somebody posts of it.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE NOT THE NUMBERS ON THE SIDE OF AN FPV CAMERA.
 *
 * The list used to be 90 to 120 with a note that real cameras run 135 to 160
 * degrees diagonal, as though the job were to type the lens's figure in. It
 * is not, and doing it is what made a regulation gate read as a distant hoop
 * and produced the report that started this: "the gates feel small".
 *
 * An FPV lens is a fisheye. A 2.1 mm lens on a 1/1.8 in sensor is close to
 * equidistant, r = f * theta, and its published 150 to 160 degrees is the
 * TOTAL COVERAGE of that projection. Three.js is rectilinear, r = f * tan
 * theta, which spends its image on the periphery: at a wide angle the edges
 * are stretched and the middle, which is the part a pilot flies a gate with,
 * is squeezed. Feeding a fisheye's coverage figure to a rectilinear camera
 * therefore matches the one property nobody looks at and gets wrong the one
 * they do.
 *
 * What has to match is the magnification at the CENTRE of the frame:
 *
 *   equidistant   half height h = f  * thetaV      so centre scale = f
 *   rectilinear   half height h = f' * tan(v / 2)  so centre scale = f'
 *   equal centres  =>  tan(v / 2) = thetaV in radians
 *
 * A 155 degree diagonal lens on a 4:3 sensor has a vertical half angle of
 * 77.5 * 3/5 = 46.5 degrees = 0.8116 rad, so tan(v/2) = 0.8116 and v = 78
 * degrees. The old default of 100 was showing the middle of the frame
 * tan(50)/tan(39.05) = 1.47 times too small.
 *
 * 85 is the default rather than 78 because the trade is real: a rectilinear
 * projection cannot have both a fisheye's centre magnification and its
 * peripheral coverage, and a racer needs to see the next gate before they are
 * pointed at it. At 85 on a 16:9 panel the view is still 117 degrees wide,
 * against 129 at the old 100, and the middle of the frame is 1.30 times
 * larger. The list brackets it so a pilot can take the honest 75 or give it
 * back for width, which is a lens choice on a real quad too.
 *
 * NOT THE SAME LEVER AS EITHER SCALE. GATE_SCALE in src/game/track.js makes a
 * gate bigger in metres and WORLD_SCALE in src/render/frame.js used to make
 * the aircraft smaller. Neither can change how big a gate looks, because a
 * bigger gate seen from proportionally further away is the same picture.
 * Apparent size is this file's, and only this file's.

 * 115 exists because a pilot asked for wider, naming the HDZero nano's
 * published 162 diagonal. The derivation above still stands: that 162 is
 * fisheye COVERAGE, and typing it into this rectilinear camera would need
 * tan(v/2) at angles no projection plane can hold. 115 on a 16:9 panel is
 * about 141 degrees of horizontal coverage, past the nano's own 132
 * horizontal figure, and it pays the honest price the comment describes,
 * the middle of the frame at 0.58 of the default's magnification. It is
 * the widest stop this projection can offer without the periphery turning
 * to smear; anything closer to the real lens is a fisheye shader, which is
 * a different round.

 * WHERE THE CAMERA IS BOLTED, in metres in the body frame.
 *
 * The FPV view was placed 7.75 cm in front of the centre of gravity and at
 * exactly its height, while the five inch's model mounted the camera 8.0 cm
 * forward and 1.8 cm UP. The forward offset is the one that
 * matters most and it was there; the vertical one was missing, and it is not
 * nothing. A roll is about the body x axis through the CG, so a camera above
 * that axis swings sideways as the craft rolls, and at a 670 deg/s roll rate
 * 1.8 cm of arm is 0.21 m/s of lateral camera motion. That is the parallax
 * that tells a pilot the lens is on a machine rather than floating at its
 * centre of mass.
 *
 * These live here rather than being typed again in main.js so the view and
 * the model cannot drift apart, which is how the 7.75 against 8.0 happened.
 * They are the five inch's, and every quad's view still sits there: the
 * quads left after it went (2026-10-03) have no mount of their own yet.

/*
 * LENS SHAKE.
 *
 * The plant now has a vibration model, but it lives on the gyro reading,
 * because the airframe really is a rigid body and what shakes is the plate
 * the flight controller is bolted to. The camera is bolted to the same plate,
 * so the pilot should SEE it, and until now the view was perfectly steady
 * while the controller fought a spectrum of noise.
 *
 * THE BAND IS DELIBERATELY LOW. Real vibration is at the prop fundamental,
 * 130 to 430 Hz, and no display can show that: at 60 frames per second
 * anything above 30 Hz aliases. What a real FPV feed actually shows is the
 * beat between the prop frequency and the camera's own frame rate, which is
 * low frequency and looks random, plus frame flex. So the model is a 3 to 14
 * Hz band, which is what survives to the screen, rather than a pretend 200 Hz
 * that would only ever alias into hash.
 *
 * Amplitude goes as rotor speed squared, the same imbalance law the gyro
 * model uses, so it is invisible on the pad, present on the power, and it
 * grows through a punch. 0.22 degrees RMS at full throttle was about two
 * and a half pixels of swim at 1080p and 85 degrees of vertical field, and
 * a pilot flying this build called it too much, the same report as the
 * gyro injection it is paired with. 0.06 degrees is about two thirds of a
 * pixel: a hint that the motors are spinning, not a feed you fly through.
 *
 * FRAME RATE INDEPENDENCE IS NOT FREE AND ONE CONSTANT WILL NOT DO IT. Both
 * poles are exact exponentials of the frame's own dt, which handles the
 * spectrum, but the band's GAIN still moves: measured over four million
 * samples, the RMS of (fast - slow) runs 0.601 at 30 fps, 0.755 at 60, 0.846
 * at 144 and 0.871 at 240. That is a 45 percent swing, so a hardcoded divisor
 * would make the shake grow with the frame rate, which is precisely the class
 * of bug this project spends its comments on.
 *
 * It has a closed form. For an AR(1) f with coefficient a and unit variance,
 * low passed by an AR(1) s with coefficient b,
 *
 *   var(s)     = (1 - b)(1 + ab) / ((1 + b)(1 - ab))
 *   cov(f, s)  = (1 - b) / (1 - ab)
 *   var(f - s) = 1 + var(s) - 2 cov(f, s)
 *
 * which reproduces the measured 0.7552 at 60 fps exactly. It is evaluated per
 * frame, which is a dozen flops, and the shake then measures the same at any
 * rate. Nothing here reaches the simulation, so there is no determinism claim
 * to break and Math.random is fine.
