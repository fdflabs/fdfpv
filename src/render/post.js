/*
 * post.js: the post processing chain.
 *
 * Three passes at full resolution, and they are three rather than four
 * because P3 allows four and the frame has to keep one in hand:
 *
 * 1. A geometry prepass into one RGBA8 target, then an edge pass over it.
 *    The prepass packs the view space normal into rg and a linear view
 *    depth into ba, so the edge pass reads normal and depth in the same
 *    fetch. Inverted hull outlines only give you a silhouette around an
 *    object; an edge pass over depth and normals also finds the creases
 *    inside it and the line where an object meets the ground, which is
 *    what reads as ink.
 *
 *    The same five geometry fetches also drive the antialiasing. There is
 *    no separate resolve: the composer target carries no multisampling,
 *    because 4x multisampling an RGBA16F target at 1080p costs 116 MB and
 *    the whole render target budget is 120 MB. The edge pass already knows
 *    where every silhouette in the frame is and which way it runs, so it
 *    resolves them with two colour taps along the depth gradient. The ink
 *    threshold is deliberately high, so it has its own much lower coverage
 *    threshold: a silhouette too subtle to ink still gets resolved.
 *
 * 2. Bloom, kept deliberately tight and low. Cel shading and heavy bloom
 *    fight each other; this is here only to make the gate rings and the
 *    sun glow, which is what pulls the eye to the next gate.
 *
 * 3. A grade, which is also the output pass: mild FPV barrel distortion, a
 *    highlight shoulder, a cool lift in the blacks against a warm gain in
 *    the lights, vibrance, a vignette, and then the sRGB transfer. It does
 *    the transfer itself rather than handing the frame to an OutputPass,
 *    because that was a fourth full resolution pass and a fourteenth
 *    texture tap to apply one curve.

   *
   *   before   0.383 and 0.363 RMS, worst 1.57 and 1.57 px
   *   after    0.192 and 0.217 RMS, worst 0.52 and 0.77 px
   *
   * The crossings say it more plainly than the RMS does. Before, they held
   * at 679.51 for six rows and then jumped a whole pixel, six more, jump,
   * which is what a staircase is. After, they walk: 679.65, 679.52,
   * 679.51, 679.39, 678.85, 678.68, 678.54. The run to run spread is real
   * and it is the wind: the grass and the tree seen through the aperture
   * move between runs, which moves the depth on the far side of the edge,
   * so one capture of this number is not evidence and two are the minimum.
   * The mountain skyline in the same frames sat at 0.215 RMS and 0.46 px in
   * every run, so the ring, not the mountains, was the most aliased
   * silhouette in the frame, and it was aliased because of this mask.
   *
   * The lake pays too, and that one is visible rather than statistical.
   * Trees standing in the water were inked and resolved from their own
   * depth while the water was drawn over them, so a submerged trunk
   * arrived as a dark line lying on the surface. Measured down a column
   * through one, 0.346, 0.459, 0.302, 0.214, 0.353, 0.454 became 0.346,
   * 0.459, 0.454, 0.454, 0.454, 0.454: the ink under the water is gone,
   * because the water now occludes it, which is what the colour buffer was
   * saying all along.
   *
   * The fix is the mechanism the grass already uses. Write depth with a
   * sentinel normal of zero, which the ink pass recognises and refuses to
   * ink, on itself or within one texel of itself, while the coverage term
   * still sees the depth step. So layer 1 objects that qualify are
   * promoted onto PREPASS_DEPTH_LAYER and drawn in the SAME pass as the
   * grass: no new pass, no new render target, no change to P3 or P4.
   *
   * Which ones qualify is the object's own declaration, not a list here.
   * If a material writes depth in the colour pass and blends normally it
   * is an occluder, and an occluder the prepass cannot see makes the ink
   * and the coverage disagree with the frame. If it does not write depth
   * it is not an occluder, and stamping a depth for it is a lie the second
   * difference will believe. That rule takes the water, the flowers, the
   * gate ring and its halo, and it leaves out the sky dome and the gate's
   * additive glow. Both exclusions are refusals of part of the review
   * finding that asked for them, and both were measured rather than
   * assumed:
   *
   * - THE SKY STAYS OUT, and the finding that the skyline receives no
   *   coverage is wrong on the coverage half. The skyline gets coverage
   *   precisely BECAUSE the sky is absent: the target clears to depth 1.0,
   *   so a ridge at depth 0.3 sits against a 0.7 depth step and the
   *   coverage term saturates. Measured above: 0.215 px second difference
   *   RMS over 118 consecutive rows of a ridge with a 0.657 px per row
   *   slope, which is better than the 0.288 to 0.304 this project has
   *   measured for 4x multisampling. Putting the dome in instead replaces
   *   that 0.7 step with 0.577 minus the ridge depth, and worse, hands the
   *   dome's own 40 by 24 tessellation to a second difference that has no
   *   business reading it. Measured, with the dome rendered into the
   *   prepass through a back sided copy of the normal material so it is
   *   not culled: the same 118 rows went from 0.215 to 0.567 RMS and from
   *   0.46 to 1.45 px worst, and the crossing picked up a period two
   *   zigzag it did not have (1175.56, 1175.64, 1174.58, 1174.67 against a
   *   monotone 1176.23, 1175.80, 1175.26, 1174.81). It is a 2.6x
   *   regression on the exact quantity the finding wanted improved, so it
   *   is refused. The ink half of the finding is right and is NOT fixed
   *   here: a sky pixel's cleared rg is (0,0), which is
   *   the same sentinel the grass writes, so grassNear suppresses ink for
   *   one texel around every skyline in the frame. Removing that costs the
   *   grass its exemption and belongs to whoever changes the sentinel
   *   encoding, not to a layer mask.
   * - THE GATE GLOW STAYS OUT. It is a 2.6 x aperture plane, doubled
   *   sided, additive, depthWrite false, coplanar with the gate frame, and
   *   its fragment shader is a Gaussian band that is zero at the plane's
   *   own border. There is no silhouette in the colour buffer for coverage
   *   to resolve, and stamping one would lay a flat 3.96 m square of depth
   *   over the gate, the ring included, at the gate's own depth. Measured
   *   on all 14 glows, forced in through a double sided sentinel so the
   *   plane could not be culled: the ring's inner edge came back to 0.311
   *   RMS and 0.84 px worst, above both of the runs this round's fix
   *   measures at, so it undoes most of the fix it was meant to extend. It
   *   also costs the gate frame a coverage step of its own against the far
   *   ridge, where 0.261, 0.206, 0.052, 0.024 became 0.261, 0.261, 0.201,
   *   0.024. Refused.
   *
   * The cost of what IS in. Measured back to back on the gate camera at
   * 1600 by 900, because scene.js is being edited beside this file and the
   * first attempt at this pair read 149 against 174 with scene.js changing
   * between the two captures, which is not a delta of anything. Back to
   * back on one scene.js: 30 meshes promoted, being 14 rings, 14 halos, the
   * lake and the flower field, and nothing else. P1 draw calls 166 to 174,
   * P2 triangles
   * 1,919,169 to 1,924,729, P3 full resolution passes 3 and 3, P4 taps per
   * pixel 10 and 10, P5 render target bytes 90.2 MB either way, and no
   * target is created, resized or bound that was not bound before. P3 and
   * P4 do not move because they count fullscreen quads and this is
   * geometry, but the frame does rasterise 5,560 more triangles into the
   * prepass target, and that is a real cost stated here rather than hidden
   * behind a budget whose definition happens not to see it.
   *
   * Clouds are NOT on layer 1 any more. They used to be, and because the
   * prepass skipped the whole layer they wrote no depth, so the ink pass
   * drew the silhouettes of mountains standing behind them straight across
   * the cloud.
