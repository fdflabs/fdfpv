/*
 * ghostcraft.js: the ghost's airframe.
 *
 * The same machine the player flies, built by the same builder, wearing a
 * hologram: every panel and motor is replaced with one translucent mint
 * material, mint because that is the colour this product paints a record
 * in, and a ghost IS a record, flying. Reusing the craft's own builder is
 * the point: the ghost must read as "that exact aircraft, again", not as a
 * second model that drifts out of step the next time the airframe changes.
 *
 * The builder comes from src/render/craft.js's table by airframe id, so a
 * wing's ghost is a wing. The id is optional and defaults to the five inch,
 * which is what every caller passed by omission before there was a choice.
 *
 * Session lived, like the hero craft in craft.js: built once, re-parented
 * into whichever scene is active by the shell, never disposed with a map.
 * The lite build is used (no inverted hulls, no shadow casters), the blade
 * rotors are removed in favour of the spun-up prop discs, since a ghost is
 * always in flight, and every original material is disposed after the swap
 * so nothing it compiled stays registered with the cel clock.
 *
 * Above the craft floats a small name tag, a sprite drawn once per label
 * change, so a pilot two gates back can see who they are chasing.
