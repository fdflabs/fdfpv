/*
 * shell.js: everything that outlives a map.
 *
 * There are two kinds of map: tracks, and the freestyle city.
 * They are built by different code with different render pipelines. What they share is
 * a renderer, a canvas, a camera and an airframe, and none of those may be
 * rebuilt when the player changes map: a WebGL context is expensive, the
 * camera's layer mask is a contract the post chains read, and re-creating the
 * craft would recompile its cel materials for nothing.
 *
 * So the split is: this file owns the session, a MapInstance owns the world.
 * A MapInstance owns its scene, its post chain, its colliders and its contact
 * data, and disposes all of it when it is swapped out, which is what keeps
 * only one map's render targets alive at a time. The contract a MapInstance
 * must satisfy is written down in src/maps/README.md.
 *
 * The renderer's own state is deliberately NOT set here. The two maps want
 * different shadow filtering and different clear colours, and a map that
 * silently inherits the other one's renderer state is the kind of defect that
 * only shows up on the second map you load. Each map applies what it needs in
 * applyRendererState.

   * ROOTS THAT OUTLIVE A MAP.
   *
   * The craft is session lived and the maps are not: the shell builds it
   * once and re-parents it into whichever map's scene is active. A map's
   * dispose has to hand it back before disposeSceneGraph runs, or the walk
   * frees the geometry and the cel materials of the aircraft the pilot is
   * still flying. disposeSceneGraph's own header states that invariant.
   *
   * The field map used to keep it by capturing shell.quad at BUILD time,
   * which is wrong twice over. Boot always builds a five inch and
   * applySettings swaps to the whoop afterwards, AFTER loadMap has already
   * captured, so on a whoop the map held the dead five inch group: its
   * scene.remove was a no-op and the live craft was disposed with the
   * world. Measured with a deleteBuffer hook over three forced rebuilds,
   * that cost 320 buffer deletes on the first and 119 and 117 after, the
   * extra 203 being the whoop. Nothing visibly broke because three
   * re-uploads whatever it finds missing, which is most of why it survived.
   *
   * And the craft was never the only one. main.js parents the ghost rig
   * into the same scene whenever a ghost is on screen and nothing ever
   * detaches it, so its geometry, its two materials, its sprite material
   * and its name tag canvas were freed on every map swap. The tag texture
   * is not in SESSION_TEXTURES, so that one is a live object being freed,
   * not merely a re-upload.
   *
   * So the register lives here rather than in each map. Anything session
   * lived says so once with keepAcrossMaps, a map's dispose calls
   * evictSessionRoots, and no map has to know what the list is. The craft
   * is always in it and is read at call time, never captured, because
   * swapCraft replaces craft.group and the register has to follow.
   *
   * DO NOT "tidy" this by calling keepAcrossMaps(craft.group) once at boot.
   * The Set would pin the boot-time five inch for the life of the session
   * and every aircraft swap after it would go unprotected, which is the
   * exact defect this replaced, moved one level down.
