/*
 * scene.js: the world.
 *
 * Art direction, in the order it matters:
 *
 * Value structure. The sky is the brightest thing, the ground sits a clear
 * step below it, and objects sit a step below that, so a silhouette always
 * separates from what is behind it. Everything else is detail.
 *
 * Warm light, cool shadow. Handled by the ramp in celmat.js, but the world
 * has to cooperate: the hemisphere light is sky blue from above and warm
 * green from below so bounce reads as grass light, and the fog is the same
 * hue as the horizon band of the sky so distance dissolves instead of
 * clipping.
 *
 * Ground detail near, silhouettes far. The turf is the terrain's own
 * colour. Grass blades are not drawn: they were scaled to a few
 * centimetres and vanished at racing height while still costing half a
 * million triangles twice a frame. Trees and rocks carry the near
 * parallax, and the mountain rings carry the horizon.
 *
 * All static scenery is authored directly in Three.js space (y up). Only
 * the quad's simulated state crosses frames, and that conversion lives in
 * frame.js and nowhere else.

 * THE GROUND, TRACED OFF THE CLUB'S OWN AERIAL.
 *
 * The world used to be an invented valley with a lake in it. It is the West
 * Coast club's flying ground now: an open paddock ringed by native bush, the
 * pavilion along its southern edge, the car park off its eastern corner, and
 * nothing else out there. The lake is gone.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS THE PHOTOGRAPH'S, THE SIZE IS NOT, and that is a decision the
 * owner made rather than an approximation that crept in. Measured off the
 * aerial, the clubhouse spans about 61 percent of the paddock's width. In
 * here it spans 22 percent, because the pavilion is built at its real 53 m
 * and the built in circuit is 210 m wide and needs 15 m of scenery standoff
 * all round. Both cannot be true at once: matching the photograph's
 * proportions means either shrinking the circuit to about 90 m, which moves
 * every gate and voids the track record and every time posted against it, or
 * drawing the pavilion at 146 m. So the OUTLINE is traced exactly, in the
 * proportions the aerial gives, and scaled up until the course fits inside
 * it. Every structure stays its real size.
 *
 * The outline below is the paddock's five corners read off the aerial in
 * pixels, normalised by the paddock's own width and by its southern edge,
 * which is the line the pavilion stands on. Keeping them normalised is what
 * lets the one number underneath decide how big the ground is without
 * touching the shape.

 * THE X IS NEGATED AGAINST THE AERIAL'S PIXELS, and that is a compass
 * correction rather than a typo.

 * over the field. In a right handed, Y up world their right hand is
 * cross(forward, up) = cross((0,0,1),(0,1,0)) = (-1,0,0). So EAST, the side
 * the aerial puts the car park on, is NEGATIVE X, and +X is the pilot's left.
 *
 * Read straight off the photograph's pixels the whole ground came out mirrored:
 * the diagonal boundary that runs down the west side of the paddock sat on the
 * pilot's right, and the car park was on the wrong side of the field from
 * anyone who actually flies there. Negating here fixes the outline, and the

 * and is the price of the feature.
 *
 * WHICH GATE WEARS WHICH is not decided here. `forGate(i)` is asked for the
 * dress of the i'th dressed structure in flying order and answers round

 * line of flags wears: sail i carries mark i mod n with the accent i mod 2,
 * which needs lcm(n, 2) entries before it repeats. A gate's own header
 * pennants are not part of that run: both of them wear THAT GATE'S mark, in
 * the two accents, because a gate flying two sponsors' pennants over one
 * sponsor's board is not what a sponsor bought.
 *

/*
 * A course marker flag: the feather banner that lines a race course.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE OLD ONE, in the order a pilot notices it. The
 * cloth was a 0.55 m plane whose CENTRE sat 0.58 m out from the pole, so
 * its near edge was 0.305 m clear of the mast: the flag was not attached to
 * anything, it hovered beside its own pole. The pole itself was a 1.6 m
 * cylinder whose centre was pushed to y = 1.7, so it spanned 0.9 to 2.5 m
 * and floated 0.9 m off the grass, while the collider ran from the ground
 * to 1.6 m and agreed with neither. And a rectangle on a stick is not what
 * a race course is lined with.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE ONE AFTER THAT. It was a teardrop on a straight
 * mast, which is a real product and is not the one the owner's reference
 * photograph shows. A race course is lined with FEATHER flags: the top of
 * the mast is a fibreglass whip that sweeps forward, the sail is a tall
 * narrow panel hanging off it, and the mast side of its head is swept away
 * by the bend. No outline cut on a straight mast makes that silhouette. The
 * shape now comes from `flagMast` and `flagSailProfile` in src/art/banners.js,
 * so the world, the builder's preview and the print cannot disagree about
 * it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. A ground spike, a mast that bends, and a sail whose LEADING
 * EDGE IS THE MAST: every vertex of the seam sits on the pole's own surface
 * all the way round the bend, which is what makes it a flag rather than a
 * poster near a pole.
 *
 * SIZE, and it is a compromise between two things that both matter. On a
 * real course the flags stand over the gates, which is what the reference
 * photographs show and what the owner asked for. But the note the previous
 * build left is still binding: the flags were once 3.4 m on a 0.106 m pole,
 * 2.23 times the gate's aperture and 3.2 times the thickness of the gate's
 * own structural tube, and at 30 m the target gate subtended 23 px while a
 * nearby flag pole gave 435. The mistake there was the POLE, not the
 * height: an 18 mm mast carries a 2.9 m sail without ever being the widest
 * thing beside the gate, so the flag can stand over a 2.4 m gate the way it
 * does on a field and still not out measure it.
 *
 * The sail does not move from JavaScript. Its motion is in the cel
 * material's cloth term, driven by the clock every cel material already
 * carries, so all 72 sails merge into one draw call and still fly. See
 * CLOTH_CHUNK in celmat.js.

   * renderer, because the outline prepass in src/render/post.js overrides
   * every material in the scene with one of its own, and that override is
   * FrontSide. A flag turned so the camera sees its back therefore wrote no
   * depth and no normal into the prepass at all, so the composite resolved
   * that region against the background and blended the sail into whatever
   * was behind it. Every flag is yawed at random, so about half of them were
   * transparent and half were solid, which is exactly what it looked like.
   *
   * Emitting the reversed triangles here makes the sail an ordinary opaque
   * two sided SURFACE that every pass agrees about: the prepass sees front
   * faces from either side, the shadow map does too, and the material can go
   * back to FrontSide.
   *
   * The normals are NOT flipped with the winding, deliberately. The cloth
   * displacement in celmat.js moves each vertex along its own normal, so
   * flipping them would drive the two sheets apart by twice the wave
   * amplitude and split the flag down the middle. Sharing the normal costs
   * the reverse face its own lighting, which on a flat cel shaded banner is
   * a difference nobody can see.
   *
   * THE REVERSE HAS ITS OWN VERTICES NOW, and only because it has to have
   * its own texture coordinates: it reads the other half of the sheet. It
   * shares everything else with the front, position, wave and normal alike,
   * so the two sheets still move as one piece of cloth and the paragraph
   * above still holds. Fourteen rows of five is seventy vertices; doubling
   * that is nothing, and it is what stops every mark on the course reading

   * The circuit is 569.6 m of arc, measured by walking __trackPoint at
   * 4000 samples. At eight stations that is 71.2 m of empty air between
   * gates. Measured from the spawn frame with __nextGate at 1600 by 900,
   * eight stations put the next gate 67.7 m out at 15.4 px of aperture and
   * 436 px left of centre, and the one after it 96.1 m out at screen
   * x = -1356, entirely off the side of the frame. So the pilot could see
   * exactly one gate, near the edge, and had to fly the rest from memory.
   * Fourteen stations put the next gate 46.3 m out at 17.8 px and 195 px
   * off centre, and the one after it 74.0 m out at 16.6 px and IN FRAME.
   * Two gates readable at once is the whole point: that is what tells you
   * which way the course turns before you commit to the one in front.
   *
   * The alternative was to shrink the circuit, which is what the spacing
   * complaint superficially suggests. Rejected on measurement: the
   * tightest radius of curvature on this figure eight is already 11.16 m,
   * at u=0 where the timing gate stands, which costs 3.7 g of lateral
   * acceleration at 20 m/s. Scaling the curve to put eight gates 40 m
   * apart means scaling that radius to 4.7 m, or 8.7 g at the same speed,
   * and the course stops being flyable at racing pace. More gates on the
   * same geometry changes the spacing without touching the flight feel.
   *
   * Even spacing is also now correct on its own. At eight, stations 2 and
   * 6 landed exactly on the figure eight's crossover at the origin, where
   * each one's posts stood in the other branch's racing line, so those two
   * were shifted by hand. Fourteen divides so that the nearest stations to
   * the crossover sit at u=0.2143 and u=0.2857, which is 20.3 m of clear
   * air either side of it: the crossing is open, framed by a gate on each

   * down that three rings at three levels of one amber read as a corridor

   * next gate a different hue. That was not enough either: a hue separates
   * two objects a pilot is already looking at, and the report is about not
   * knowing where to look.
   *
   * The tiers then collapsed to two, owner's call: the TARGET is lit, a
   * subtle green glow that turns red from the wrong side, and EVERY other
   * obstacle carries no markings at all. A PVC frame in printed vinyl is
   * what a gate on a real field looks like when nobody is aiming at it,
   * and the follow tier's dim ring turned out to be one more thing
   * competing for the eye. A flag's glow follows the same rule: lit as
   * the target, dark otherwise, sitting on the pole and the cloth rather
   * than as a square beside them, and the print stays visible because the
   * light is additive and modest.
