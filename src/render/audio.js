/*
 * audio.js: motor noise as a flight instrument, and a mix around it.
 *
 * Pilots fly quads by ear as much as by eye: the blade pass tone tells you
 * what the throttle is doing before the picture does, and the beat between
 * four slightly different motor speeds is what makes a quad sound like a
 * quad instead of a drone. So this is per motor, driven by that motor's own
 * RPM, not a single throttle-scaled loop.
 *
 * THE MOTOR REGISTER, and why it is low. An earlier round's graph put the
 * oscillators in the kilohertz range with square partials to 8 kHz, and the
 * owner called it loud screaming. The fundamental IS the blade pass
 * frequency now, motor RPM over 60 times the blade count, which on this
 * plant is 130 to 430 Hz in flight: a hum with body rather than a saw in
 * the presence band. A chosen periodic wave through a lowpass whose corner
 * tracks the fundamental but is CAPPED gives the harmonics that make it
 * read as a motor and nothing above them. An earlier round lowered the cap
 * from 1150 to 1000 Hz and the default motor stem from 0.6 to 0.5, in the
 * owner's words "low softened quiet, not obtrusive", which is also how the
 * shipping simulators mix it: motors just audible under the wind, never
 * the loudest thing in the render.
 *
 * IT WAS STILL THE LOUDEST THING IN THE RENDER. On a flight trace the
 * motor stem measured -18.45 dBFS against the music's -28.34 and the
 * wind's -32.99, so every one of those claims was aspiration rather than
 * measurement, and the owner came back with a number: the motors need to be
 * about 70 percent quieter than the music. 70 percent quieter in amplitude
 * is a factor of 0.3, so 10.5 dB of RATIO, and it is split rather than
 * taken all from one side: 4.0 dB off the motor voice gains here, 6.5 dB on
 * to the bed in music.js. The split is forced. The motors were carrying
 * the mix's loudness, and taking the whole 10.5 dB off them alone measured
 * a flight render at -24.7 dBFS, outside the -20 to -14 dBFS band the
 * loudness bar asks for. Every figure is in PROGRESS.md either side of
 * the change. The flight instrument survives because the information is
 * in the PITCH, which is untouched.
 *
 * THE AMBIENCE IS GONE. It was a looped lowpassed-noise buffer with a
 * handful of sine birds, and the owner heard it as a hum. The stem, the
 * bake, the settings row and the airspeed fade are all removed. A saved
 * ambienceLevel is ignored.
 *
 * MOTORS AND WIND, 70 PERCENT DOWN. Applied on the stem buses as
 * FLIGHT_STEM 0.3, so a Motors or Wind setting of 5 is the same ratio
 * it always was, just 10.5 dB quieter against the music. The blade pass
 * pitch and the 6 dB throttle span are the voice law, not the bus, and
 * they do not move.
 *
 * THE CUES. A gate pass is a satisfying CLICK now, a knuckle of filtered
 * noise over a falling tick, not a synth blip; a frame graze is the same
 * family an octave and a half down, so the reward and the penalty cannot
 * be confused. The menu makes small clicks of the same family through
 * ui(). All of it runs on the two pooled cue voices that already existed:
 * no event creates a node.
 *
 * Music is the recorded crates in assets/music, Opus in a WebM with an mp3
 * fallback, played by src/render/music.js through one MediaElementSource
 * on this same mix. Cues still duck it. The generated drum and bass crate
 * is gone. There are two crates and setMusicContext says which one is
 * wanted: the flight records while the pilot is flying, a quieter two
 * record bed everywhere else. Cues only ever fire in flight, so the duck
 * is a flight thing and the menu bed never sees it.
 *
 * The graph is built by attach(ctx), which takes any BaseAudioContext, and
 * update() takes the time to schedule at. Both exist so that
 * scripts/audio-probe.js can build this exact graph on an
 * OfflineAudioContext, drive it from a scripted RPM trace, and render it to a
 * buffer an FFT can read. A claim about the mix with no rendered buffer
 * behind it is a claim about nothing, and there is no way to hear this
 * container. The live path passes no time and reads ctx.currentTime, which is
 * what it did before.

 * THE VOICE, which is the machine's shape as the ear hears it. The blade
 * pass frequency is what a motor's fundamental IS: each blade passing a
 * fixed point pushes one pressure pulse, so a prop with B blades at N
 * revolutions per minute radiates at BN/60 Hz. Everything else here that
 * depends on the aircraft rather than on the mix is beside it.
 *
 *   quad  Three blades, because the prop the plant is built around is a
 *         5 x 4.3 x 3. Four motors spread across the stereo field so the
 *         beat between them is audible. The loudness law tops out at 9000
 *         RPM and the wind at 32 m/s, the numbers every figure in
 *         PROGRESS.md was measured at, and the wind's lowpass stays where
 *         it was measured too.
 *   wing  One motor, a 6 x 4 two blade, in the centre of the field because
 *         a pusher sits on the centre line behind the camera. Slots 1 to 3
 *         arrive at zero RPM from the plant and fall under MOTOR_MUTE_RPM,
 *         so they are silent by the same rule that silences a parked quad;
 *         nothing here special cases them. The loudness law tops out at the
 *         plant's 17,600 RPM, which is 0.85 of the no load figure at full
 *         duty, and the wind at the wing's 24 m/s top speed. The wind is
 *         the instrument on a wing, since a glide has no motor at all, so
 *         its lowpass opens with airspeed: a hiss that brightens as the
 *         wing speeds up, under 2 kHz still so the cues keep their band.
