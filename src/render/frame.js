 * The basis change used everywhere below, a proper rotation:
 *   x_three = -y_sim   (screen right is the quad's right)

/*
 * How much larger the world is than the aircraft, as a pure number.
 *
 *   world metres = sim metres / WORLD_SCALE
 *
 * IT IS 1, AND THE HISTORY OF WHY IT WAS NOT IS THE REASON THIS COMMENT IS
 * LONG.
 *
 * The owner flew it and reported "the gates and the town are too small
 * compared to the drone". The response was to set this to 1.25, on the
 * reasoning, written down here at the time, that "at 1.25 every solid thing
 * in both maps stands a quarter larger relative to the camera than it did".
 *
 * That reasoning is wrong, and the second report, "the gates feel small and
 * the field is large", is what it produces. This scale divides the craft's
 * displacement about the sim origin. It does not touch the world, so it
 * cannot change how big anything in the world LOOKS: the on screen height of
 * a gate is
 *
 *   pixels = viewportHeight * clearH / (2 * depth * tan(fov / 2))
 *
 * and WORLD_SCALE appears nowhere in it. A gate seen from 10 world metres
 * subtends exactly the same angle at 1.25 as it does at 1. What the scale
 * does change is how much sim distance buys a world metre, so at 1.25 the
 * craft crossed every course a quarter slower and a 542 m lap had to be
 * flown as 678 m. That is the whole of the "field is large" report, and on a
 * project that publishes lap times to a leaderboard it is worse than a feel
 * problem: it is a quarter added to every time.
 *
 * So the lever was the wrong one. Apparent size is the CAMERA's, and the
 * camera is where it has been fixed: see src/render/lens.js, which carries
 * the derivation. Here, 1 restores the property that makes the rest
 * of the project's dimensions mean anything, which is that a metre in the
 * physics is a metre in the world.
 *
 * The seam stays, because it is the right seam if the ratio is ever wanted
 * again: this file is already the one and only conversion between the
 * physics frame and the world frame, and a scale is exactly that kind of
 * conversion. Everything the shell measures in world metres (terrain
 * heights, collider boxes, the surface bias, gate apertures) is the world's
 * own truth and does not pass through here. Everything that is a fact about
 * the airframe (its 0.110 m arm, its 2.0 m/s landing gate) stays in sim
 * metres, because a landing leg does not care what scale the town was built
 * at. tests/thresholds.json carries the declared value so that changing it
 * has to be done in two places on purpose.
