/*
 * celmat.js: the cel shading model.
 *
 * The thing that separates a good cel shaded world from a flat one is not
 * the banding, it is that light and shadow are different HUES, not the
 * same hue at two brightnesses. Sunlit surfaces go warm, shadowed surfaces
 * go toward the blue of the sky bouncing into them. Breath of the Wild
 * leans on this constantly and it is why its shadows read as air rather
 * than as dirt.
 *
 * That is done here with a coloured gradient ramp. Three.js samples
 * MeshToonMaterial's gradientMap by N dot L and multiplies the result into
 * the base colour, so an RGB ramp that runs cool to warm gives the split
 * for free while keeping Three's own shadow, fog and light machinery.
 *
 * On top, onBeforeCompile injects two things Three's toon material does
 * not have: a fresnel rim light tinted toward the sky, which separates
 * silhouettes from the background at distance, and a specular band for a
 * hard painted highlight on the craft.

   * THE PROGRAM CACHE KEY, WHICH THREE CANNOT WORK OUT ON ITS OWN.
   *
   * r160's default Material.customProgramCacheKey returns
   * onBeforeCompile.toString(), and WebGLPrograms.getProgramCacheKey pushes
   * that string into the key. Every celMaterial's onBeforeCompile is this
   * one closure, so its SOURCE TEXT is byte identical no matter what the
   * closure captured. Anything the closure bakes into the generated shader
   * is therefore invisible to the cache, and two materials differing only
   * there are handed each other's already linked program.
   *
   * cloth is the only option that does that: it decides whether the vertex
   * shader declares aCloth and injects CLOTH_CHUNK. Everything else, the
   * rim, the spec, the cloud shadow, the colour, arrives as a uniform, and
   * uniforms are per material and not per program.
   *
   * So scene.js's `printed` and its `sailMaterial` differ only in rim and
   * cloth, both invisible, and both carry a map on FrontSide with fog: to
   * three they were the same program. Whichever linked first decided
   * whether the cloth code existed at all, which is a field whose flags
   * wave or do not wave depending on the order the world was built in.
   *
   * THE KEY IS THE INJECTED SOURCE ITSELF, not a name for it. A hand
   * written 'cel' and 'cel-cloth' works today and is the bug waiting to
   * come back: the condition would then live in three places that nothing
   * couples, so a later edit to either ternary, or a second option that
   * varies the source, would leave the key stale. And it would come back
   * camouflaged, because the file would look like it had a considered
   * cache key. Deriving it from clothDecl and clothBody means the key
   * cannot disagree with the shader by construction.
   *
   * Still far shorter than what three did by default, which was the whole
   * closure source: 2361 characters, identical for every cel material.
   * Not the options object either, because that would split the cache by
   * colour and buy a compile per gate for a uniform.
   *
   * Measured on the field, before and after: sail draws using a program
   * that declares aCloth went from 0 of 55 to 55 of 55, so before this the
   * flags did not wave at all. The field's program count went 50 to 52,
   * and cel programs carrying cloth went 1 to 2. Only ONE of the two extra
   * programs is the cloth variant; the other is a non-cloth cel program
   * that used to be sharing with it. Both are the point.
   *
   * KNOWN, and not fixed here: the sail now moves in the colour pass only.
   * post.js's outline prepass overrides the whole scene with a plain
   * ShaderMaterial that has no cloth code, and three's depth material does
   * not carry onBeforeCompile either, so the ink and the shadow are still
   * rasterised at the rest pose. Before this the three passes agreed
   * because none of them waved. The disagreement is bounded by
   * FLAG_SAIL_CLOTH, 85 mm. Looked for and not found: a stale ink line at
   * the rest silhouette, absent at the camera it was hunted from.
