/*
 * attract.js: the camera behind the title screen.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE OLD ONE. It orbited a point. On the race field
 * that framed the start gate and nothing else, so a player choosing between
 * two tracks was shown the same nine metre circle whichever one they picked;
 * in the city it swung a 11 m circle round the spawn, straight through the
 * shopfronts on both sides of the road, because a circle drawn on a street
 * plan does not know there are buildings on it.
 *
 * So a map now hands over a LINE to fly instead of a point to circle, and it
 * is the map's business to make sure the line is flyable: the race field
 * derives one from its own racing line and lifts it clear of the tallest
 * structure near each sample, and the city walks its own road centreline and
 * comes back over the roofs. Neither can clip anything, because in both
 * cases the line is drawn from the same data the world was built out of.
 *
 * The orbit is also what a designed course asks for. Flying its racing line
 * is the wrong shot on a compact layout: a single triple stack's line is a
 * few metres of wrap, and the camera sprints that knot in a couple of
 * seconds. The map hands over a point, a radius and an eye height framed
 * from the course's own bounds, and this file circles it. Empty custom
 * courses keep the old nine metre spawn circle, because circling nothing is
 * a better shot of an empty pitch than a flight round nothing.
 *
 * TITLE HERO. The camera stays ON that cleared line. The session airframe
 * is posed a couple of metres ahead on the same line, slightly off to the
 * side so the X reads, and the overlay then nudges the frame so the quad
 * sits in the open sky next to the menu rather than under the type. Sticks
 * add a little extra attitude; they do not fly the line. Nothing here is a
 * second scene graph. When Fly is pressed the shell stops calling update,
 * seats the craft at spawn, and the same world is the flight world.

 * Slide the subject into the hole the overlay leaves. Wide: the menu owns
 * the left third, so the picture steps right and the quad sits clear of it.
 * Narrow: the menu owns the bottom, so the picture steps up and the quad
 * sits in the open sky above it.
 *
 * THIS USED TO MOVE THE CAMERA, AND THAT IS WHAT PUT THE TITLE SHOT UNDER
 * THE GROUND ON A PHONE. It translated the eye by a FRACTION OF THE
 * DISTANCE TO THE SUBJECT, sixteen percent of it downwards on a narrow
 * frame, which is a screen space intent expressed as a world space move.
 * The two only agree when the subject is a couple of metres away. The map
 * hands over a shot framed from the course's own bounds, so on a track that
 * covers a field the orbit sits 15.6 m up and 60 m out, and sixteen percent
 * of that is a TWELVE METRE drop: the eye ended at 2.8 m over a shot
 * designed for 15.6, and on a wider orbit with a lower eye it ended below
 * the dirt, which is what a portrait phone was showing. Nothing clamped it,
 * because the clearance every map computes for this line is a property of
 * the line, and the eye had left the line.
 *
 * So the eye no longer moves. The offset is a LENS SHIFT: the projection
 * renders a window of the frustum offset from centre, the same trick a
 * shift lens plays, which is exactly the screen space quantity the overlay
 * asks for. The camera stays on the cleared line at every aspect, the shift
 * is the same fraction of the frame whether the subject is two metres away
 * or eighty, and scripts/attract-check.js, which probes this camera with no
 * overlay, is now telling the truth about where the shot actually goes.
 *
 * The fractions below reproduce what the old translation framed on a 16:9
 * desktop, where the subject sat about a look ahead away and the move was
 * small enough to be honest. They are fractions of the rendered frame:
 * positive Y lifts the picture, negative X pushes it right.
